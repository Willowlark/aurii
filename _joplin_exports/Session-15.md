Session 15

# The Start

Having stolen a Gozanti Cruiser, the crew of the Alai is on the run from the Empire in Hyperspace. With a hot ship most ports won't take them, leaving them with few options to scrub the ship of it's transponder codes. 

# Scenes

- [ ] Scenes

# Secrets and Clues

- [ ] A Transponder Code can be replaced by getting a new Engine
- [ ] A Transponder Code can be hidden using Code Masking, requiring a Gozanti Code to display instead of your own and a module.
- [ ] Transcoder Masks are major contraband and only large scale criminal operations will have access to them #Cadan
- [ ] Corellia builds Gozanti Cruisers, and will have supplies for replacing thier parts
- [ ] Corellia is one of the top producers of Starships in the galaxy and therefore is very good at protecting their ship yards. 
- [ ] Core Worlds are far more likely to have Imperial patrols that could spot their hot transponder code. 
- [ ] A Gozanti cruiser disappeared during a Spice run between Kessel and Nal Hutta. 
- [ ] The Gozanti Cruiser ran afowl of an Ion storm that Pirates have been following. The ship is dead in space and the pirates have moved the loot to their own ships. They're using the ship as bait for anyone wanting the spice. 
- [ ] The pirates work for Cadan, the crew of the Gozanti betrayed him and he's punishing them/setting a trap for the PCs
- [ ] ~~Imperial Gonzanti Cruisers are known to patrol Inner Rim planets instead of Star Destroyers~~
- [ ] Cadan has a spice run to make to Corellia. The buyer is fickle and has a habit of shooting messengers, but does supply codes to get to the Core Worlds unmolested. 
- [ ] Khan has a problem, there's a snitch that's blackmailing his connection the shipyards he needs gone.
