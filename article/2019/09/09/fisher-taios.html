<h1 id="vitals">Vitals</h1>

<p><strong>Age:</strong> 26, 4th October</p>

<p><strong>Occupation</strong>: Soldier</p>

<h1 id="appearance">Appearance</h1>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bIuMJbQ.png" alt="Face" /></p>

<p>Fisher is a tall man, measuring between 6’ 2” and 6’ 3”. He has blonde hair that’s medium length for a man, which is swept up with stray strands of his bangs occasionally falling into his face. He has stubble along his jawline and chin and freckles across his face and his nose. His eyes are hazel and have a piercing quality to them, giving him a form of resting bitch face. He’s muscular, with broad shoulders.</p>

<p>Fisher wears a black long sleeve undershirt with a chain mail shirt on top of it. The mail only extends to his upper arms. Above the mail shirt he wears a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/f8/2c/d9/f82cd9a5e71704053082319a6e8de3d3.jpg">tunic</a> which buttons to the side rather than the center of his chest. The tunic is fairly low cut and mail is visible underneath, it also extends slightly below the tunic on his torso. The tunic’s various collar flaps can be flipped up and buttoned to form a shield in front of his face, useful while in flight. The tunic is predominantly black, with green accents. He has a gauntlet on his right forearm, trimmed in black. His pants are black as well, sturdy material for comfort on Wyvern back. He wears high boots, coming up half to his knee.</p>

<h1 id="history">History</h1>

<p>Fisher was almost a teenager when Dryn Wulfa took over the nation of Dreca. He was too young to be involved directly, nor interested enough in the ruling class to care about the upheaval. He then grew up in the post coup Dreca, one that was ramping itself up for war against the mainland. Fisher was impressionable, and got swept into the newly formed military academies right out of school, happy to serve the charismatic Dryn.</p>

<p>Fisher excelled as a warrior, quickly adapting to any weapon he was given. He settled in on Jian style blade eventually, mixing the short blade’s quick strikes in with unorthodox fighting using his offhand and feet. Due to his promise, he was given a recommendation to try for the Wyvern Corps. A wyvern bonded with Fisher and he was shifted into the advanced academy. Fisher finished his training around the age of 20, not top of his class but one of the top three actual fighters in the class. He wields a lance while on his wyvern.</p>

<p>Fisher deployed right out of the academy, placed on combat patrols of the Erian-Drecian front and serving on a strike team for missions around the Kissaelain territories. Here, his national pride began to take hits. He saw his compatriots, more seasoned soldiers, relishing in the killing and fervor Dryn had drummed up. Against Eraian troops Fisher knew what had to be done, and fought well. He continued to accel in the military, being relied on for less sanctioned missions. Fisher was eventually deployed to raise a civilian town on suspicious of it harboring escaped laguz slaves. Already not a fan of the practice, his motivation was lacking. His flightmates began to raze the town without warning, and Fisher had a moment of clarity, seeing a woman huddled to protect her children from the flames.</p>

<p>Fisher realized that national pride has gone too far for the Drecians, and that Dreca were monsters. Fisher saved that woman, and deserted the town that night. He took to the mountains east of Theanovene for a spell, avoiding his old wingmate’s pursuit. Eventually he started into Theanovene, getting a feel for the mainlanders Dryn had taught him to despise. Fisher found them to be people, just like himself, and all of what he strived for fell apart around him. Fisher, lost without purpose, has started wandering Theanovene, Callora and Eraia trying to see what of Dryn’s words were truth and what was not. He’s lost his drive, only to stay alive and find out who is the force of good in this world.</p>

<h1 id="personality">Personality</h1>

<p>Fisher is a lost individual. He has always followed the Drecian propaganda to the letter, but could no longer believe in it seeing the people of the mainland first hand. He is inherently simple, he wants to strive for a greater goal, to make the world better. He thought Dryn was aiming for that same goal and now that Fisher can’t follow Dryn he feels lost in the crowd. He doesn’t feel like he belongs in the Dreca that he grew up in anymore, and wants to be needed, but isn’t sure who he can trust anymore.</p>

<p>Fisher is quick to pick up physical skills and follows orders well. He has some skill at leading a group as well, but he prefers to follow. He’s open to suggestion and only recently has started questioning things asked of him, now to sometimes crippling level.</p>

<p>Fisher is a jock, in a sense. He’s been in the military much of his life and doesn’t have much sense for decorum or class. While he is currently reserved and observant, trying to find his new moral compass so to speak, when he is relaxed he’s competitive and enjoys challenges. Bettering his physical talents is enjoyable to him and he strives to maintain top form even outside of the military. Other aspects of military life carry over as well, he doesn’t sleep late or sleep heavily, and is utilitarian on some personal life aspects. He doesn’t dislike his militaristic nation, nor what he learned with Dreca’s. He feels the direction Dreca is going in is wrong.
