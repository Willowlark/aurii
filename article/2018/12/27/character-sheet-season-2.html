<h2 id="template-summary">Template Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: Self explanatory.</li>
  <li><strong>Fate Points</strong>: Fate points are used to do a variety of special actions in game. You start with 3, and either regain them after an arc or when your aspects are <em>compelled</em>; used against you in some way. Keep track of them here.</li>
  <li><strong>Stress</strong>: Stress represents the number of hits you can take before you are out of an encounter. Everyone has three stress boxes. You fill them in (<code class="highlighter-rouge">[X]</code>) when you take damage.</li>
  <li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Consequences are serious injuries you can take that keep you in the fight, but provide a weakness others can exploit against you and often take longer to heal. <em>Mild</em> injuries are worth 2 stress boxes, <em>Moderate</em> are worth 4, and <em>Severe</em> are worth 6 stress. (<em>Mild</em> consequences are injuries that heal after the fight, like a “Sprained Ankle”. <em>Moderate</em> heal at the end of the arc, like “Slashed Arm”. <em>Severe</em> are long term injuries that won’t heal till appropriate, like “Broken Leg”.)</li>
  <li><strong>Aspects</strong>: Phrases that represent your character’s beliefs, passions, problems and talents, something special about a person, place, thing or group. “A person might be the <em>Greatest Swordswoman on the Cloud Sea</em>. A room might be <em>On Fire</em> after you knock over an oil lamp. After a time-travel encounter with a dinosaur, you might be <em>Terrified</em>.” They are either invoked, providing a bonus to you, or compelled, where they penalize you or boost your enemies. You can have up to 5.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Approaches</strong>: Each character is better or worse at doing things certain ways. Assign one of the following to each of the approaches: <code class="highlighter-rouge">+3</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">+2</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">+2</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">+1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">+1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>. Whenever you take an action, you’ll receive the bonus of the closest description of how you’re doing that action; IE if you’re being <em>Careful</em> you get to add your <em>Careful</em> bonus.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Stunt</strong>: Stunts are special abilities your character can preform. They are created by filling in one of the following phrases:
    <ul>
      <li>Because I <code class="highlighter-rouge">describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of gear, or are otherwise awesome</code>, I get a +2 when I act <code class="highlighter-rouge">pick one: Carefully, Cleverly, Flashily, Forcefully, Quickly, Sneakily</code> when <code class="highlighter-rouge">describe a circumstance</code>.</li>
      <li>Because I <code class="highlighter-rouge">describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of gear, or are otherwise awesome</code>, once per arc I can <code class="highlighter-rouge">describe something cool you can do</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p><strong>Name</strong> Yuria Faun</p>

<p><strong>Fate Points:</strong> 3
<strong>Stress:</strong> [ ] [ ] [ ]
<strong>Consequences:</strong>
2  Mild:

6  Severe:</p>

<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>

  <li>I’m the Inquistor, not my family.</li>
  <li>Judge me by my actions, nothing else.</li>
  <li>These are my ears and this is me.</li>
  <li>A flawless execution leads to flawless victory.</li>
  <li>Cyn is my personal indulgence.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Approaches</strong>

<p>(A sample of each)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because I <code class="highlighter-rouge">am an Inquisitor of the Eraian Church</code>, I get a +2 when I act <code class="highlighter-rouge">Careful</code> when <code class="highlighter-rouge">planning a mission in advance</code>.</li>
  <li>Because I <code class="highlighter-rouge">have a close bond with my Partner Cyn</code>, once per arc I can <code class="highlighter-rouge">have Cyn appear in the nick of time 'just as planned'</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="aspects">Aspects</h1>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Aspects should be <strong>double edged</strong>; which means it can be both a good thing and a bad thing. <em>Super Nerd</em> can mean your smart, but it can also mean you’re an easy target for bullying.</li>
  <li>Aspects should <strong>say more than one thing</strong>; or the aspect describes more than thing about your character. <em>I want to prove myself</em> says one thing about the character, <em>I want to prove myself to my lawyer father</em> says more than one thing.</li>
  <li>Aspects should <strong>keep it simple</strong>; <em>Child blessed with Pastoral Bliss</em> may sound catchy, but it’s harder to relate to what’s going on in the game. <em>Son of an expert farmer</em> says the same thing but is far clearer.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are some guidelines for choosing aspects. Aspects which don’t help you tell a good story (by giving you success when you need it and by drawing you into danger and action when the story needs it) aren’t doing their job. The aspects which push you into conflict, and help you excel once you’re there, will be among your best and most-used. Aspects need to be both useful and dangerous; allowing you to help shape the story and generating lots of fate points and they should never be boring. The best aspect suggests both ways to use it and ways it can complicate your situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Significant personality traits or beliefs</strong> Sucker for a Pretty Face, Never Leave a Man Behind, The Only Good Tsyntavian Is a Dead Tsyntavian.</li>
    <li><strong>The character’s background or profession</strong> Educated at the Academy of Blades, Born a Spacer, Cybernetic Street Thief.</li>
    <li><strong>An important possession or noticeable feature</strong> My Father’s Bloodstained Sword, Dressed to the Nines, Sharp Eyed Veteran.</li>
    <li><strong>Relationships to people and organizations</strong> In League with the Twisting Hand, The King’s Favor, Proud Member of the Company of Lords.</li>
    <li><strong>Problems, goals, or issues the character is dealing with</strong> A Price on My Head, The King Must Die, Fear of Heights.</li>
    <li><strong>Titles, reputations, or obligations the character may have</strong> Self- Important Merchant Guildmaster, Silver-Tongued Scoundrel, Honor-Bound to Avenge My Brother.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="yurias-aspects-invokes-and-compels">Yuria’s Aspects, Invokes, and Compels</h2>

<p>A good way to test your aspects for the above traits is to make up some scenarios where they would give you benefits or penalities. I’ve done so for Yuria Faun (the example before) below. If you can come up with more than one <em>Invoke</em> and <em>Compel</em> scenario for your aspect, it’s probably a very good aspect!</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’m the Inquisitor, not my family.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Invoke</strong>: When needing access to a restricted area of the church, I can spend a fate point to enter due to my rank.</li>
      <li><strong>Compel</strong>: When a superior officer says he chose me for my family name, I could be compelled to snap and tell him I’d rather be seen by own merit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Judge me by my actions, nothing else.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Invoke</strong>: When trying to work with people who are judgmental of nobles, I can spend a fate point to get them to just look at me, not my class.</li>
      <li><strong>Compel</strong>: When I hear someone is speaking lies about me, I could be compelled to investigate the liar whose making judgements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These are my ears and this is me.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Invoke</strong>: When I’m being put down publicly by a racist, I can spend a fate point to get a bonus in telling the man off.</li>
      <li><strong>Compel</strong>: When I encounter abused laguz slaves, I could be compelled to help them as they remind me of myself.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A flawless execution leads to flawless victory.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Invoke</strong>: When plan A actually works and everything is as I predicted, I can spend a fate point to keep things from deviating from the plan.</li>
      <li><strong>Compel</strong>: When needing to make a snap decision, I can be compelled to to force everyone to slow down to make a better plan.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cyn is my personal indulgence.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Invoke</strong>: When trying to be roguish and spontaneous, I can spend a fate point to act like Cyn because of our bond.</li>
      <li><strong>Compel</strong>: When Cyn makes a request, I can be compelled to go along even if I don’t want to because he would for me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
