<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>

<h2 id="narrative-truth">Narrative Truth</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Within the imagined world of your shared narrative, everything the players describe happens exactly how they describe it , when they describe it. This is called “the Principle of Narrative Truth” and it’s the nitrous that makes Wushu fast and furious. Actions should always be phrased in the present tense: “I kick him,” “I fly over that,” “They crash through the wall like wrecking balls.” No need to wait for the dice to tell you what happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Keep in mind Wushu is written with the idea of kung fu movies. Some of the phrasing in the book is flavored with that.) Some other things of note about writing for the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t be a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>. It’s okay to lose. It’s okay to do poorly. Flaws make better characters than skills do.</li>
  <li>Don’t avoid the problem, solve the problem. If you need to land a crashing plane, flying away with a jet pack does not solve the problem. Getting into the cockpit and trying to land it despite the busted controls is solving the problem.</li>
  <li>Something I want to emphasize. Much like in reality, if you don’t show an interest in other people you won’t get any interest your way. Take an interest in working with the other characters in the game and you’ll have much more fun playing.</li>
  <li>When in doubt about a scene your character is in: A scene should show something. There’s no scene in a book or movie that doesn’t either reveal something about a character, advance the storyline, hint at something later, create a new bond between characters, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conflict-resolution">Conflict Resolution</h2>

<p>When you need to do something in Wushu, and there’s an <em>obstacle</em> in your way, you have to score a number of hits against the obstacle. The Gamemaster will assign that number, which is nicknamed the <em>threat level</em>. You score hits by doing the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You don’t have to roll for an action if there’s no opposition to you doing it.</strong> If you want to walk down the street, read a book, learn a new skill, eat a cheeseburger, you can. Unless something or someone is actively preventing you from doing it (trying to get through a <em>locked</em> door, fighting a person) you don’t need a die roll. Play by posts are bogged down by dice rolls, and even at that every Dm’s Guide from D&amp;D to Wushu itself will tell you only roll dice when necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Narrate what you’re doing. The more details, the better!</li>
  <li>For every detail in your action, the gamemaster will reward you with a die. You’ll be given a number of dice to roll. (The maximum for this pool of dice is consistent for everyone in the conflict.)</li>
  <li>The gamemaster will tell you what your <em>relevant aspect</em> is. This is the aspect on your character sheet that most relates to what you’re doing. Your <em>target number</em> is the number related to that aspect.</li>
  <li>Decide how many dice that, if rolled as hits, will reduce the <em>threat level</em> (attack dice) and how many dice will protect you from damage (defense dice).</li>
  <li>Roll all the attack dice and then all the defense dice. For every die that comes out <strong>less than or equal to</strong> your <em>target number</em>, you succeed. Every success on an attack die reduces the threat level by one, every success on a defense die prevents on damage done to you.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="npcs">NPCs</h2>

<p>You are allowed to introduce a new NPC to scene, if that NPC makes sense to be there. Don’t put the pope in the sewers, but a priest being in a church makes sense. This NPC can’t give you plot relevant information, but can hold a short conversation with your character. If you want to buy beer from the bar for example, the GM doesn’t need to write in the innkeeper for that. You can also introduce the character as someone your about to talk to, with an opening line or wave or the like. If you do that, the DM can take over the character you popped into the scene.</p>

<p>The only exception to using NPCs is ones that the GM is <em>voicing</em>, or controlling in the scene. GM controlled NPCs can’t be controlled, even for minor things. An NPC currently being ‘controlled’ or that was introduced into the scene before by another player can be interacted with; but don’t take the NPC from that player without shooting them a message asking first.</p>

<h2 id="damage">Damage</h2>

<p>At the start of a fight, every player character receives 4 hit points. Every round the threat you’re fighting deals <em>one automatic hit</em> to every player. If you rolled defense dice, any successes you rolled with them are used before your hit points.</p>

<p>Enemies that are more than just mooks have their own hit points and rather than a single automatic hit they get to roll their own attack and defense dice. You’ll be informed when a <em>Nemesis</em> appears in a scene.</p>

<h2 id="side-goals">Side Goals</h2>

<p>Often you will do something in a turn that is unrelated to defeating the threat or objective of the action. These side goals in the scenario also have a threat number to be defeated. The only difference is that a side goal does not get an automatic hit against the players. These side goals do not have to be completed, though it’s almost always in your benefit to complete them.</p>

<h2 id="wushus-rule-book"><a href="http://danielbayn.com/wushu/">Wushu’s Rule Book</a></h2>

<h1 id="the-gameplay-areas">The Gameplay Areas</h1>

<h2 id="ic-in-character">IC (In Character)</h2>

<p>These channels are the primary gameplay areas. They can be compared to the table everyone would be sitting around in person. These channels, at least in the beginning, will be dedicated to the <em>group</em> events. Everyone in one of the parties will be involved in the events in these channels. There are multiple channels available because it’s not expected all of you will be in a massive group all the time. Smaller parties may form and do different things at the same time, and that will branch into two different channels in this section.</p>

<h2 id="asides">Asides</h2>

<p>If the IC channels can be summed up as <em>posting</em>, the asides channels can be summed up as <em>chatting.</em> In posting, there’s a rotation to it; GM, players, Gm, players. Chatting is being able to immediately go back and forth with the other participant.</p>

<p>If you decide your character would like to have a conversation with another character in the party privately, the asides are the place to do it. Same goes if you’d like to grill an npc you met. An aside is characterized by a conversation out of the usual game flow. An aside takes place mid another scene, and which scene it takes place in will be marked down. This does mean you can’t go across town for your asides, but where ever you are you can certainly step around the corner or into another room to have a chat. Asides are <strong>not</strong> for things that change the scene, moving your characters away from what they’re taking an aside from. They should not be used for a ‘multipart’ scene either; the aside should happen and then end.</p>

<h3 id="dos-and-donts">Do’s and Don’ts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Do have an aside when you want to converse with another character in the scene at length.</li>
  <li>Don’t have an aside when you want to ditch the group for awhile. (This is splitting the party, you’d likely end up on a second IC channel.)</li>
  <li>Do have an aside when you want to add a scene to a time skip such as ‘you travel the rest of the day and eventually make camp’. (you could have a conversation on the trail, in camp, etc.)</li>
  <li>Don’t try to advance the IC channel’s events from the aside. You may have decided to steal from Bob in your aside, but you have to <em>do</em> the stealing in the IC channel.</li>
  <li>Do message the GM if you need dice rolled for anything.</li>
  <li>Don’t have your aside somewhere completely unrelated to the IC channel you asided from. (You were in a general store, your aside shouldn’t take place in the woods.)</li>
  <li>Do your asides quickly, the faster they’re done the faster the channel can be used for a new one.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="start-and-formatting">Start and Formatting</h3>

<p>The ideal way to start is to contact the other party out of character and setup a time you both can have the aside. (You are not obligated to do a suggested aside.) Let the GM know which channel you’ll be taking, sign on together, and type away! If you find it’s going longer than you expected that’s okay, just be proactive about finishing the aside sooner rather than later. (Orphaned asides can and will be ended prematurely.) This is the same for both NPCs and other players.</p>

<p>Formatting wise, there should be an opening post which can be pinned to the top of the channel looking like the below. Fill in your information and post that before you start. This should be reminiscent of the way scene’s change in the IC channels.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Location: &lt;location&gt;
Coming from: &lt;the location you were at before you asided&gt;
Characters: &lt;list of characters&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="character-generation">Character Generation</h1>

<h2 id="aspects">Aspects</h2>

<p>Aspects are defined in the <em>Fate Core</em> book as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aspects are phrases that describe some significant detail about a character. They are the reasons why your character matters, why we’re interested in seeing your character in the game. Aspects can cover a wide range of elements, such as personality or descriptive traits, beliefs, relationships, issues and problems, or anything else that helps us invest in the character as a person, rather than just a collection of stats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aspects are short phrases that sum up an <em>aspect</em> of your character’s personality. In Wushu, almost the exact same thing is referred to as a trait. If you aren’t good at witty phrases, that’s okay. <em>Fate</em> has a few tips for that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re struggling to make an aspect, write out the idea in as many words as you need to, in order to get it down on paper in the first place. If a specific phrase pops up after you write it down, great! If not, maybe someone else at the table can help you come up with an aspect. And if you’re still stuck, leave it for now; you’ll have plenty of time during play to refine it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paraphrasing a longer section on aspects, the best aspects have three parts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Aspects should be <strong>double edged</strong>; which means it can be both a good thing and a bad thing. <em>Super Nerd</em> can mean your smart, but it can also mean you’re an easy target for bullying.</li>
  <li>Aspects should <strong>say more than one thing</strong>; or the aspect describes more than thing about your character. <em>I want to prove myself</em> says one thing about the character, <em>I want to prove myself to my lawyer father</em> says more than one thing.</li>
  <li>Aspects should <strong>keep it simple</strong>; <em>Child blessed with Pastoral Bliss</em> may sound catchy, but it’s harder to relate to what’s going on in the game. <em>Son of an expert farmer</em> says the same thing but is far clearer.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are some guidelines for choosing aspects. Aspects which don’t help you tell a good story (by giving you success when you need it and by drawing you into danger and action when the story needs it) aren’t doing their job. The aspects which push you into conflict, and help you excel once you’re there, will be among your best and most-used. Aspects need to be both useful and dangerous; allowing you to help shape the story and generating lots of fate points and they should never be boring. The best aspect suggests both ways to use it and ways it can complicate your situation. Aspects that cannot be used for either of those are likely to be dull indeed. Bottom line: if you want to maximize the power of your aspects, maximize their interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, you don’t want your aspects to overlap. Have them define different parts of your character. Wushu provides three suggestions for aspects, covering different parts of your character. They are <strong>Motivation, Fighting Style,</strong> and <strong>Profession</strong>. Below are example of aspects from <em>Fate Core</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Significant personality traits or beliefs</strong> Sucker for a Pretty Face, Never Leave a Man Behind, The Only Good Tsyntavian Is a Dead Tsyntavian.</li>
    <li><strong>The character’s background or profession</strong> Educated at the Academy of Blades, Born a Spacer, Cybernetic Street Thief.</li>
    <li><strong>An important possession or noticeable feature</strong> My Father’s Bloodstained Sword, Dressed to the Nines, Sharp Eyed Veteran.</li>
    <li><strong>Relationships to people and organizations</strong> In League with the Twisting Hand, The King’s Favor, Proud Member of the Company of Lords.</li>
    <li><strong>Problems, goals, or issues the character is dealing with</strong> A Price on My Head, The King Must Die, Fear of Heights.</li>
    <li><strong>Titles, reputations, or obligations the character may have</strong> Self- Important Merchant Guildmaster, Silver-Tongued Scoundrel, Honor-Bound to Avenge My Brother.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="assorted-thoughts-on-aspects-from-me">Assorted thoughts on aspects from me:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Phrase them as something your character might say. “I am X so Y”. It helps you get in their mindset about the aspect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write out 6 aspects and then sort them by how core they are to your character. Try to express different aspects of the character’s personality via them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An aspect can be referenced in many situations, it’s something that sort of represents a way the character interacts with situations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You don’t want two aspects that say the same thing. Spread out, explore some other aspects (no pun intended) of their personality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If you need help with aspects, I recommend crowd sourcing it to the channel.</strong> It’s hard to come up with them sometimes, in my opinion.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="approaches">Approaches</h2>

<h2 id="points-assignments">Points assignments</h2>

<p>6 point spread, each approach starts at 2. Can’t have a 6 in an approach, range is 1-5.</p>

<h2 id="fate-points">Fate Points</h2>

<p>Each player begins with 3 Fate points. Fate points are used to <em>invoke</em> aspects and are rewarded/spent when being <em>compelled</em> by an aspect.</p>

<h3 id="invoking">Invoking</h3>

<p>When an aspect of the character feels relevant to a challenge the character is facing, a character can <em>invoke</em> that aspect by spending a Fate point. This translates to an additional 2 dice in your dice pool, and these dice can <em>exceed</em> the dice pool limit.</p>

<p>One can also invoke an aspect on <em>another aspect in the scene</em>. That aspect could belong to another character involved, a situation that’s occurred, or it could be even tied to the location the scene is in. An example of this could be you are facing off against a person with the Aspect “Hard to Calm Down”. You say that because he is hard to calm down, he won’t be able to avoid your attack because he’s raging too much. You can get an invocation bonus in that scenario for <em>making use of the world around you.</em></p>

<h3 id="compels">Compels</h3>

<p>A compel will usually come from the GM side. A compel is a challenge to a character, saying “Because of your Aspect X, you would do this action.” Usually, the action being compelled is a negative one that will cause more trouble for the character and the people around them. The exact details of the action can be discussed between the compeler and compelee, but the core of the action will remain the same. Because of this, when you do the action you’re being compelled to do, you are <em>rewarded one Fate point</em>. If you decide your character will not do the action in the compel, you must <em>spend one Fate point</em> to resist the compulsion.</p>

<p>Sometimes compels will be less about a character’s decisions and just about how they are. If a character has an Aspect “Strange Luck”, sometimes that Aspect will be compelled against when something strange happens around the character. Since the strange thing was going to happen anyway, you get a free Fate point.</p>

<p>It is possible for a player to compel against an opponent in combat. If the “peg legged pirate” is chasing you across his ship, you might point out that he’s got a peg leg and can’t run that fast. If the GM agrees, you can spend a Fate point to give a penalty to the opponent because of their aspect.</p>
