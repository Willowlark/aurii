        <h1>The Kissaelain Territories</h1>
        
        <div  markdown="1">
        
            <p><em>Kissaelain (Ki-sa-lay-n) is the collected term for Cat and Tiger Laguz.</em></p>

<h2 id="ruling-class">Ruling Class</h2>

<p>Kissaelain Laguz towns are so few in number they don’t operate as a nation. Town mayor (called a <em>Baron</em> by natives) is the highest political rank one can achieve.</p>

<h2 id="culture--social-classes">Culture &amp; Social Classes</h2>

<p>Kissaelain laguz originally had no claim to land. After slavery was outlawed in the human dominate kingdoms, many laguz had no where to go. The south eastern section of the continent seemed like a good place to push them, and push them the kingdom’s did. The hot temperment of the south east made crops challenging to grow and the land was hard to live on. If not for their Laguz traits, the laguz probably would not have lasted. However last they did, hunting in their beast forms and keeping small towns afloat. Towns were even starting to build up before Dreca attacked.</p>

<p>Kissaelain Laguz culture has been carried through centuries of oppressed living. Tradition is important to Kissaelain laguz the same way it is to their wolf laguz cousins, but many years of living with human culture has tempered that interest. Kissaelain tradition is all oral tradition, if not in the form of long stories in the form of sayings and witicisms. Kissaelain culture follows them where ever they end up, which historically is anywhere the humans told them to.</p>

<h2 id="military">Military</h2>

<p>The Kissaelain territories had no standing military when Dreca attacked. The towns in the territories aren’t organized enough to coordinate something of that scale. That said, every laguz can fight in their beast form and has beast traits to give them an edge over normal humans. Despite the advantages, Dreca’s show of military force drove Kissaelain from their homes.</p>

<h2 id="trade--economy">Trade &amp; Economy</h2>

<p>Kissaelain kept to itself in the grand scheme of things. Like with military, they weren’t terribly organized which made out of territory trade more difficult. They also haven’t been around all that long to settle into a plan. The territories directed all of their energy into providing for themselves in the challenging savannah climate. Individual traders who travelled the distance into Kissaelain towns were able to make excellent sale and trade with the laguz, though the number of that was low.</p>

<h2 id="foreign-relations">Foreign Relations</h2>

<p>The territory was not united enough to have a political stance with other countries.</p>
