            <p><em>Cal-lor-ah : Legacy and Loyalty</em></p>

<h2 id="note-on-the-kingdoms"><em>Note on the kingdoms</em></h2>

<p><em>Each heading under Callora will have a section for Etrina, Torshan, Dwyr, and Rocnas. These are four kingdoms that take a primary role in the League politics. Each has the backing of nearby smaller kingdoms that align with the larger state’s political viewpoint. The four groups will have some detail to each of them, rather than for two dozen smaller kingdoms.</em></p>

<p><em>The Calloran League, or Calloran Federation, is the largest grouping. This is populated by four regions, the Etrina Region, the Torshan Region, the Dwyr Region, and the Rocnas Region. Each region is formed of small kingdoms. These regions are formed not by physical, but political borders, the kingdoms contained within all have similar political views and the kingdoms the regions are named after serve as the primary voice for the group.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-calloran-confederation-treaty">The Calloran Confederation Treaty</h2>

<p>The Calloran Confederation Treaty was signed during the first Eraian crusade. Fearing that the large crusading force would conquer each of the small kingdoms on the north half of the continent, the Kingdom of Etrina send messengers to every Kingdom between Theanovene and the Eraian border. A council was held, and the King of Etrina spoke passionately about how as individuals, their way of life will be stamped out by Eraia, but united, even Eraia couldn’t hold against them. The kingdoms were varied and different, but each felt the same responsibility, that of defending their culture and way of life.</p>

<p>The Council came to a Treaty. The treaty dictated that the Kingdoms of the north would be a Confederation, a group of independent kingdoms that protect each other. No cultural restrictions were placed into the treaty, as protecting their individuality was the goal to begin with. The treaty covered military requirements by the members of the Confederacy, and some minor economic restrictions. Those who attack one member of the Confederacy, or League, attacked all members. The kingdoms were not required to play nice with one another, even being allowed to close borders to one another, but in the case of military action they must stand united. This combined show of force gave the League the ability to repel the first Crusade, and eventually end it in a ceasefire.</p>

<h2 id="ruling-class">Ruling Class</h2>

<p><strong>Type of Rule</strong>: Confederacy</p>

<p>Callora is a union of kingdoms formed by the kingdom of Etrina during the first crusade of Eraia. The League persisted after the crusade and is more commonly recognized as a whole than its parts. It is not without internal political struggle, but in the international sense Callora acts as one. Most kingdoms are monarchies in the League.</p>

<h3 id="etrina">Etrina</h3>

<p>Etrina is ruled by the original Etrinan royal family that founded the league. The family still commands much respect from the League as a whole due to their forefathers forming the League in the first place. However, the royal family is not the same as it once was and the current generations are quite content using their legacy to command power rather than earning it themselves.</p>

<h3 id="torshan">Torshan</h3>

<p>Torshan has had multiple internal revolts over the last century. The current royal family has only been in power two generations, and barely that. Torshan is a passionate nation, one easily prone to following a charismatic leader in their objectives. This volatile culture is what sparked so much revolution and while Torshan garners respect for its size and ability to keep functioning mid revolt, it’s royal family has the least respect of the four nations due to it’s lack of legacy. <em>It’s commonly said that if you need evidence of the passage of time, look for the changing of the seasons or a new king in Torshan.</em></p>

<h3 id="dwyr">Dwyr</h3>

<p>Dwyr’s royal family are all accomplished mages and scholars, and rule in a lawful, logical sense. The nations around Dwyr adopted some level of Dwyr’s adherence to order, but in more rational degrees. However, Dwyr is always fair to it’s neighbors and speaks for the whole’s best interest in the League’s councils, so it’s neighbors don’t mind the very rigid Dwyian family.</p>

<h3 id="rocnas">Rocnas</h3>

<p>Rocnas is furthest from Etrina and Eraia, and has always felt separate from the other areas in the League. Originally they joined the League as to not be surrounded entirely by this new nation due the southern mountains, they have always been quiet in regards to international politics. The kingdoms around Rocnas are heavy on farms and fishing and they are content to keep the status quo of farming and trading their crop. The royal family of Rocnas is almost as old as Etrina’s, and they set the conservative tone of the Rocnas region. Rocnas is more often than not non vocal on issues in the League, though for a few topics (particularly isolationism) they are quite steadfast.</p>

<h2 id="culture--social-classes">Culture &amp; Social Classes</h2>

<p>Children are recognized as adults at 14 for boys and 16 for girls. The League has various schools in it’s different regions, and plenty of children attend them in hopes of finding a role outside farming or serving. The League has a large schooling culture, even compared to the Church of Lylalel (which is more indoctrination than schooling) and encourages study.</p>

<p>Laguz are treated somewhat differently in every region. Etrina treats them as second hand citizens, and at this point wonders why any of them are left in the kingdom after giving them the Kissaelain Territories. Torshan considers Tigers to be powerful allies, and cats useless. Cats are kicked around and often abused, while Tigers are given jobs to make use of their powerful alternate form. Dwyr is largely tolerant but is not particularly supportive of laguz issues. Rocnas considers laguz to be better than humans, and good luck. Laguz can find good work on a Rocnas farm, where life will be simple but they will be respected.</p>

<p>The Callora region has a temperate climate, and is very green. It’s got a mix of forests and mountains, with plains in between.</p>

<p>Deer is a common meal in Callora, as is rabbit. Livestock is preferred kept for their byproducts (milk, eggs, etc) and not killed for meat. Having beef in Callora is a delicacy. Somewhere in between is salt water fish, which must be exported from the northern coast. Callora has a large amount of natural berries growing in their woods, which no one has had success replanting. Foraging for said berries is a common summer job for children.</p>

<p>It’s a taboo to serve any less than the whole loaf of bread. It’s an old tradition, the bread is to represent Calloran unity and serving part of it implies there is a part of Callora that is unaligned with the rest.</p>

<p>There is extradition between Calloran kingdoms. If you commit a crime in one nation and are from one of the others, you will be sent back to that nation first. This has been abused in the past, with the home nation not punishing nearly as hard for a crime.</p>

<p>Marriage is fairly normal in Callora. Divorce is not allowed, as marriage is a symbol of unity and Callora is firm on such things. Widow/ers often have difficulty getting remarried as well, for similar reasons. Marriages are a forever promise in Callora.</p>

<p>A military man wearing any insignia from a kingdom in the League is to be saluted. No matter the Kingdom they would protect you, and that earns them respect.</p>

<p>Callora has fox hunting as a sport. It’s not only done by nobles, but by knights and soldiers as a way to train their technique in tracking and mounted archery. Tangentially, Callora has issues with overhunting and occasionally finds woods barren of game.</p>

<p>Callora is not reserved with greetings, hugs, handshakes, and in some kingdoms even kisses on the cheeks are acceptable. Placing two fingers on the forehead of someone is a sign that you’ll be watching over them.</p>

<p>A married woman is always to be introduced before her husband is, and an unmarried woman is always introduced after the men in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Crusader” is an insult in the League; referring to someone pushy, foolish, or rude.</p>

<h3 id="etrina-1">Etrina</h3>

<p>Etrina has a tendency to eat high fiber foods. Where they are located those kinds of plants and grains are more common.</p>

<p>Etrinan royalty has a perchance for overly large dresses and showy outfits. This preference makes it’s way down to the peasantry, even they tend to have more flutter in skirts and ruffles in shirts than needed.</p>

<p>Etrina is notorious hard on brothel type activities, very few manage to operate and they only do so by being incredibly secretive. The owners of the establishment are punished when they are shut down, not the workers.</p>

<p>One’s ability to ride a horse is a sign of class and status. The better a rider, the more respect they will get.</p>

<p>Duels are allowed in Etrina and political standing can be gained from them. However, one cannot challenge someone in a position below them.</p>

<h3 id="torshan-1">Torshan</h3>

<p>Baked goods are considered delicacy in Torshan. Baking requires too many materials to do consistently. Any baked good will sell for double the price in Torshan.</p>

<p>Torshan is a very gesture heavy region, they like to mime as they talk.</p>

<p>Scars and calluses are a sign of experience in Torshan.</p>

<p>A child’s word means nothing in Torshan.</p>

<p>Torshan culture encourages a lie that doesn’t hurt anyone, but ridicules anyone who gets caught in the lie. It’s a game of sorts, fooling someone gets you high praise and failing to makes you a laughing stock. There are many pranksters in the region.</p>

<p>Torshan has a surprisingly romantic courtship ritual. A man is to literally whisk his love away for the day, to bring her somewhere she’s never been and wow her. Being passionate about one another is required at every step, constantly requiring the new couple to do more. It’s very easy for those from the culture; they grow up seeing grand gestures of love and romance in the streets all the time.</p>

<h3 id="dwyr-1">Dwyr</h3>

<p>Wine is more popular than water in Dwyr. Many say it’s because without the sticks in Dwians asses would kill them.</p>

<p>Dwyr mage academies popularized short robes, which only fall to past the knee. It’s unusual to show so much leg in other areas, for men and women, but people find them comfortable and relaxing to work in. Dwyr clothing is also softer than other areas, due to the quality of make.</p>

<p>Dwyr has a shorthand ‘sign language’ many know. It was made to not interrupt mages at work chanting spells, but became common use by everyone.</p>

<p>Dwyr enforces a form of copyright. It’s not perfect, but if you attempt to sell another’s work as your own you’ll be swiftly arrested and locked away.</p>

<h3 id="rocnas-1">Rocnas</h3>

<p>Everyone eats together in Rocnas, no matter the social class. The royals would not have food if not for the farmers, and it is tradition to give those who harvested the food first taste.</p>

<p>Guests are given the head of the table at a Rocnas home.</p>

<p>Rocnas’s far eastern kingdoms are known for eccentric families, such as ones with inbreeding and others with polygamy.</p>

<p>Mountain climbing is a popular hobby for Rocnas people. There are many legends in Rocnas revolving around the mountains to their south and children love to search for the mysteries the mountains contain.</p>

<p>Rocnas families often take care of their elders. The homes in Rocnas are massive, large enough to support extended families.</p>

<p>The northern kingdoms in Rocnas actually practice an ancestral religion like the Wynnites. They picked it up from them.</p>

<h2 id="military">Military</h2>

<p>Membership in the League states that all kingdoms of the League have the protection of the assets of every other member’s military strength in addition to their own. By joining the military of your kingdom, you sign on to protect the entire League as a whole. This doesn’t extend to policing internal issues, but at any international level each kingdom is expected to send the bulk of their forces at the council’s direction. In defense of the League, the League as a whole has the primary command of any military asset of it’s members.</p>

<p>The League does not require involvement by all members in offensive military operations. kingdoms wishing to make an offensive gesture are to bring it forth to the council. Other kingdoms may pledge support at that time, or choose to not involve themselves. The council also decides if the League blesses the military action; without the blessing of the League any counter attack to the attacking state(s) will not get the required military support stated above. In the League’s history, no kingdom has gone through with offensive action without the blessing of the League.</p>

<p>The League has a variety of military assets due to their size and spread of people. When gathered together, the League can muster a force comparable to that of Eraia. However, the entirety of the League’s military might has not been gathered since the first Eraian crusade.</p>

<h3 id="etrina-2">Etrina</h3>

<p>Etrina contributes two primary assets to the military. Etrina’s plains are home to many herds of wild horses and Etrina’s kingdoms has long mastered the art of cavalry battle. Cavalry trained in Etrina is some of the best in the world, and while Etrina doesn’t produce quantity, they produce quality. Etrina also has a tactical school of renown. Most tacticians in the League train there.</p>

<h3 id="torshan-2">Torshan</h3>

<p>Torshan provides man power and weaponry to the military effort. One of Torshan’s primary exports is weapons and armor, so in times of war their considerable population is put to work smithing enough equipment to arm every kingdom. That same considerable population fills out the ranks of the League army as well, though due to the high turnover rate of leadership in the kingdom, there are few with experience in Torshan’s ranks.</p>

<h3 id="dwyr-2">Dwyr</h3>

<p>Dwyr, unsurprisingly, brings magical power to Callora. Dwyr is most hesitant to involve themselves in combat, but when they do their mage corps are ruthless. Dwyr primarily uses anima magic, though rumors of a dark magic specialist group do exist. Dwyr’s non magical military forces are as small as possible, and are only used for internal policing.</p>

<h3 id="rocnas-2">Rocnas</h3>

<p>Rocnas has a large navy to protect their fishing ships from pirates. As the other areas of the League lack any considerable naval force, Rocnas accepts that their navy is more of a group asset. The kingdom has a naval academy as well. Rocnas has limited group troops, and prefers to keep them in the kingdom.</p>

<h2 id="trade--economy">Trade &amp; Economy</h2>

<p>The Calloran League trades with Theanovene and Wynne heavily. Theanovene provides items available from Eraia and recently Dreca, while Wynne provides items only available in the northern nation. The League is the primary source of spreading Wynnite items across the world, as Wynne refuses to trade with anyone else. Tentative trade agreements have been set up with Eraia, but they haven’t taken off due to old political tensions.</p>

<p>International trade is usually brokered through Etrina, being the oldest kingdom and founding one. It’s not a popular arrangement, but works.</p>

<h3 id="etrina-3">Etrina</h3>

<p>Etrina exports include foodstuffs and horses, as well as mined materials from it’s mountains.</p>

<h3 id="torshan-3">Torshan</h3>

<p>Torshan area primarily exports weaponry and smithed items. Popular imports are rare foodstuffs and southern items.</p>

<h3 id="dwyr-3">Dwyr</h3>

<p>Dwyr is the largest source of Tomes in the world, it being their primary export. Books of all kind tend to make their way to Dwyr, and Wynnite goods are also popular.</p>

<h3 id="rocnas-3">Rocnas</h3>

<p>Rocnas primarily exports foodstuffs, and imports newer technologies. Farm equipment, magic, etc, Rocnas tends to be behind other nations in development and chooses import over internal development. Rocnas’s exports feed a large portion of the League and are highly valued.</p>

<h2 id="foreign-relations">Foreign Relations</h2>

<p><strong>Theanovene</strong>: Theanovene, as a neutral state, is on good terms with all the Calloran political groups. Theanovene is fond of the League, they consider the League to be the most peaceful group to work with.</p>

<h3 id="etrina-4">Etrina</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wynne</strong>: Wynne continues to have respect for the Etrina of old that united all the kingdoms, even if Etrina is no longer living up to that legacy. Wynne considers Etrina a good ally. Etrina is quite used to Wynne, even if they like the Naissankari a bit too much for Etrinan taste, and treat them like anothe member of the League.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eraia</strong>: Etrina is both terrified and curious of Eraia. Etrina wants Eraia as an ally, but knows Eraia hasn’t changed much from the nation that crusaded against them in the past. Etrina is unsure if Eraia will want to attack them or befriend them tomorrow, and royalty is content to leave figuring it out to their children.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dreca</strong>: Etrina considers Dreca the enemy it doesn’t know. Dreca’s forceful march through the lower continent scares the kingdom, enough that Eraia looks friendly in comparison. Dreca doesn’t acknowledge the League’s independent parties and doesn’t care differently for Etrina than any other area.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="torshan-4">Torshan</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wynne</strong>: Torshan’s support of Dreca has alienated them from Wynne. Wynne considers the states in this region traitors to the treaties set down centuries ago. Torshan has accepted the loss of Wynne, feeling it’s still safer with Dreca.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eraia</strong>: Torshan considers Eraia the greatest enemy of the League. Eraia has tried to destroy them before and the moment they see the chance they will try again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dreca</strong>: Torshan considers Dreca a tool they can use to gain independence. By allying with the nation that seems set to conquer the mainland, they will have secured a place as an ally and not a conquered nation. They see the military might of Dreca, being southern most Calloran region, and respect Dryn Wulfa’s power.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dwyr-4">Dwyr</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wynne</strong>: Dwyr and Wynne maintain the traditional relationship between their nations. Wynne gets tired of Dwyr, especially the more rigid nations, but there’s is mutual respect between the nations. Dwyr and Wynne mostly interact over trade, rather than personal interest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eraia</strong>: Dwyr is neutral on Eraia. They acknowledge they have reason to be concerned by the theocratic empire’s apparent urge to crusade, but also realize times have changed from the first crusade. Dwyr also respects light magic study as a whole, and even Lylalel’s religion. Eraia has been known to send envoys for mutual study and learning to Dwyr countries via Theanovene, and value the nation’s focus on magic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dreca</strong>: Dwyr feels Dreca is a rash, angry nation sparked by Dryn Wulfa. Dwyr leadership respects Dryn for his tactical prowess and charisma, but fears he makes decisions poorly and is a danger to anyone around him. The fact that the nation was so easily swayed by him is a further black mark on them in the eyes of Dwyr.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rocnas-4">Rocnas</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wynne</strong>: Rocnas and Wynne maintain an amiable relationship. Rocnas being the most rustic group of the Calloran parties helps them bond with the wild Wynnite tribesmen. Wynne is not a fan of Rocnas’s isolationism preference, but lets it slide as Rocnas holds up all requirements set forth by the League treaties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eraia</strong>: Rocnas considers both Eraia and Dreca to be the “boogeyman”. They exist but are distant enough from them they are inclined not to care about them. Rocnas was barely affected by the first Eraian crusade and this left them with the idea that they are safe in their corner of the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dreca</strong>: Rocnas considers both Eraia and Dreca to be the “boogeyman”. They exist but are distant enough from them they are inclined not to care about them. Rocnas was barely affected by the first Eraian crusade and this left them with the idea that they are safe in their corner of the world.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="settlements--places-of-interest">Settlements &amp; Places of Interest</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>E - Etrina</strong>: is the capital of the kingdom the League gets it’s name from, Etrina.</li>
  <li><strong>F - Inans</strong>: The capital of the kingdom Torshan.</li>
  <li><strong>G - Airte</strong>: The capital of the kingdom Dwyr.</li>
  <li><strong>H - Rosin</strong>: The capital of the kingdom Rocnas.</li>
  <li><strong>U - Laera</strong>: The capital of the kingdomo of Laera.</li>
</ul>
