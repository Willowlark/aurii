            <p><em>Wyn-neh : Strength resides in the north</em></p>

<p><em>Naissankari (Nai-san-ka-ri) is the traditional name of Wolf Laguz.</em></p>

<h2 id="ruling-class">Ruling Class</h2>

<p><strong>Type of Rule</strong>: Meritocracy/Kratocracy</p>

<p>Wynne is ruled by the man most suited for the job. There is a formal ceremony to challenge the current head of state, challenging him either on his skills as a warrior or leader. It is not to the death; any man capable of winning in the first place is worth too much to the community to be killed. (Anyone found to have cheated in any formal ceremony however is put to death as a coward.) The head of state is in charge of both military and foreign affairs and he is advised by a council of elders (some of which were former leaders). Other ‘upper’ class ranks in Wynne are earned through proof of skill and challenges, though not directly against another person. What you provide to the country decides your rank in the country.</p>

<h2 id="culture--social-classes">Culture &amp; Social Classes</h2>

<p>People in Wynne are expected to work hard. They are a traditional, old fashioned country that often chooses the old ways over newer innovation simply because ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fit it.’</p>

<p>A boy in Wynne is considered an adult at the age of 14 (girls at age 16). While is understood they’re still growing, they are expected to work for the betterment of their village and country or purse a trade. The latter of which is considered an investment in that person’s future work, to make them even more effective down the line. Apprentices are common in Wynne for every profession as learning from an expert in a field is considered the only real way to become an expert yourself. It is rare for an adult to have multiple apprentices at a time though; it’s considered arrogant.</p>

<p>Wynne has abundant hunting due to their colder climate. Deer provide alot of the food for Wynne, supplimented with fish from the sea to the south. Wynne has few farms, between the climate and stagnate lifestyle farming doesn’t appeal to Wynnites. Anything that grows in the wild is equal parts replanted by the gatherer and returned to the village. This tradition has been in place so long that much of Wynne has edible crops growing on it.</p>

<p>Wynne dialect is a bit gruff, called by the occasional southerner ‘like they have a scratch raw throat all the time’.</p>

<p>In Wynne it is commonplace to challenge another when you feel they aren’t doing their job correctly. This stretches all the way up to Wynne’s chieftain.</p>

<p>Despite their traditional outlook on the life, as long as the work gets done and nothing illicit occurs while doing it, Wynnites don’t care about the means to the end. This allows people freedom of expression and creativity. Youth will do work in their pajamas, hunters will drink mid hunt, and chefs will take the time to cook a full meal rather than just meat and potatos.</p>

<p>If you have a new idea about doing something, such as a new hunting trail or other activity, you are expected to prove that it’s better on your own time while still completing all your other tasks. Wynne also only has one ‘weekend’ in the week. It is considered cowardly to offload work on others, you’ll be considered useless if you spend a day lazing about, and you’ll be punished if you pull another man from his work for no good reason.</p>

<p>Wynne’s religion is more spiritual than in a god. Wynne tradition states that their ancestors are reborn as the deer and rabbits that feed them, the logs that shelter them, and the steel that protects them. Every blessing of the land comes from their ancestors. Wynne has traditional ceremonies to honor those ancestors for their work beyond the mortal realm to better the land of Wynne, which encompass it’s religious aspects. These ceremonies aren’t frequent, a month minimum between any two.</p>

<p>Wynne has a long standing relationship with the Wolf Laguz village to the north of them. In a past age Wynne competed against them for food and land, the Wynnites fighting against the “demon wolves”. (Wynne has never seen an untransformed Laguz.) But that ended when a Laguz woman and Wynnite man were snowed into a large tunnel. While both sides tried to rescue their lost soul, the two of them connected, Wynnite seeing a humanoid Laguz for the first time. The two of them travelled miles underground, only surviving because they worked together, before reaching the point where their allies came charging in for them. The two of them demanded no fighting occur in that tunnel, and that both sides leave peacefully. The two promised to meet again privately, with the winds of change to their backs. Neither knew that they were the respective heirs to the villages they hailed from. They met again, and eventually married and started a tight bond between the two races.</p>

<p>In the modern era, wolf laguz are treated as a part of Wynne. They’re long respected as powerful hunters and excellent navigators in the dark woods of northern Wynne. Wolf laguz are also accepting of the Wynnite people, though the laguz ancestral home is generally considered a off limits to humans. The origin of that unspoken law was lost to time, at least from the Wynnite side, but it is well respected.</p>

<h2 id="military">Military</h2>

<p>Wynne’s military contains Infantry and a Navy. They also have the Pegasus Knight corp, which is detailed below. Wynne’s infantrymen are not taught how to fight, but how to fight with others. Wynne soldiers are expected to learn their fighting either before the war or on the job. The infantry has little in the way of fighting style restrictions, Wynne troops often look ragtag and unorganized. They are of course, anything but.</p>

<p>The Navy is more formally organized than the infantry. While not large by any means, much like everything else in Wynne hard work and skill drives each crew member to do the work of two men. In a similar vein, each ship is a force to be reckoned with on the sea. While skilled, the crews of the Wynne Navy are hamstrung by their ships. Ships are rarely built and Wynne is comfortable with it’s small fleet. Many of the ships have served decades at sea and their age puts them at a disadvantage against newer ships from other nations.</p>

<p>Pegasi are native to the island. They have heavy coats, like clydesdales. Wynne woman (traditionally, lightly built men are starting to be seen as well) can join the Pegasus Knight corp, a powerful subset of the Military. Well trained and organized, Wynne’s Pegasus Knights are a sight to behold on the battlefield, diving bombing and rescuing injured troops all without touching down. Wynne occasionally trains Callorian candidates for Pegasus Knight, and more rarely citizens of other nations. The pegasi are a Wynne treasure which they are tenative to share. It is a great honor to receive Knight training as a non Wynnian. The corps see more work in search and rescue than they do war, but they train constantly, more so than any other group in Wynne.</p>

<h2 id="trade--economy">Trade &amp; Economy</h2>

<p>Wynne’s primary exports are furs, plants that only grow in the cold weather and cold water fish. Other exports of the nation include Wynne made weaponry, cold weather equipment such as snow shoes and rarely, a pegasus, given to someone whose earned the favor of the nation. Wynne usual imports are fruits and other food that won’t grow in their region, as well as worked materials from other regions such as armors and naval parts. Wynne does almost all trade via sea, given they’re an island nation.</p>

<h2 id="foreign-relations">Foreign Relations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Callora</strong>: Callora was once the force that created the League, and who brought Wynne into it. While Wynne hasn’t forgetten this, Callora’s allowance of Eraia in it’s borders has put a strain on that respect. Wynne’s leadership is torn on the recent foolish decisions made by Callora, and the legacy it once held. While channels remain open between the l</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Torshan</strong>:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dwyr</strong>:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rocnas</strong>:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eraia</strong>: Wynne finds Eraia’s pushing of religion both a waste of time and offensive. Eraia’s expansion efforts also infringes against Wynne’s way of doing things, all the more so with Eraia trying to consume Wynne’s ally Callora. While unwilling to go war with them on their own, Wynne will happily jump into the fray with Callora when Callora wants to break the tension between the two.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Theanovene</strong>: Wynne’s culture finds Theanovene’s neutral stance cowardly. They also find it’s lack of military and trade focus cowardly. Wynne is not hostile because of these reasons, but they lack respect for Theanovene. Wynne has no interest in trading with them directly because of it, most Wynne goods actually pass through Callora before reaching Theanovene.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dreca</strong>: Dreca, much like Eraia has an expansion policy that Wynne is against. Dreca’s actions against the southern laguz also offend Wynne, as well as their overall treatment of the people and places they work through. Despite being a motivated and hard working force, Dreca is cruel and to Wynne it feels like what they could become if they slipped too far.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="settlements--places-of-interest">Settlements &amp; Places of Interest</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A - Roren</strong>: The ancestral home of the Wolf Laguz. There only a few months in year there isn’t at least a few inches of snow on the ground. The buildings and walls are all stoneworked, most decades old. The city is wholly populated by wolf laguz. There’s a single road that leads through the woods into the town.</li>
  <li><strong>B - Coudell</strong>: is the where the chieftain of Wynne currently resides. Characterized by wide streets and stone buildings. The cobblestone in the streets is pockmarked with missing stones that defeat the purpose of having them in the first place. Buildings get their heat and light from large fireplaces, occasionally multiple in a single home. Open air buildings are mostly unheard of.</li>
  <li><strong>C - Cedan</strong>: is the port city in Wynne. With the lake to the north and the ocean to the south, there are multiple rivers connecting the two. Cedan has three of them that snake through the city and there’s over a dozen bridges in the town. The largest building in Wynne is located in Cedan, a massive trade hall with a center bonfire and water access.</li>
  <li><strong>D - Aulcion</strong>: is located on the eastern border of the central mountains. Aulcion is a small village, nestled on a cliff. It’s cold and very hard living, yet the allure of breeding and training with the pegasi native to the mountains. The poplace are hardened pegasi breeders, their riders, and a militaristic staff keeping the village running.</li>
