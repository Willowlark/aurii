Key: *A: Allied; N: Neutral; T: Tension; H: Hostile* 

* **Wynne** & **Callora** have idealogical differences with **Dreca**, so despite both fighting **Eraia** they're not allies.
* **Wynne** & **Callora** are in a cold war with **Eraia**, Eraia was turned away years ago during it's first crusade and the tension never breaking.
* **Theanovene**'s decision to stay neutral against the universally disliked **Eraia** is divisive.
* **Eraia** conquered the southwestern island, it used to be it's own nation. 
* The southern pennisula on the continent is in contention between **Eraia** and **Dreca**.

*Notes: Wynne doesn't differentiate between enlisted soldiers, all warriors are equal on the field. Theanovene has no real military, so the roles it does have are more police roles. For the sake of sanity, Navy titles follow the land faring titles.*
