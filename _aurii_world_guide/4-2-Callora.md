### Kingdoms of Callora

**[Kingdoms of Callora]({% link _posts/aurii/posts/season-one/2017-9-16-kingdoms-of-callora.md  %})** The details of the individual kingdoms that make up Callora can be found here. The below information describes the alliance as a whole. 

*Game Note: Callora is by nature, a little vague. If you decide you want to be the heir to a particular kingdom with X trait and Y city, throw it into Callora. If I need a quick kingdom to cause trouble, I can throw it into Callora. Anyone who wants to work within Callora's slice of the world can do so, talk to me about it when you'd like to.*

### Ruling Class

**Type of Rule**: Traditional Aristocracy

Callora is made up of multiple smaller Kingdoms that have their own noble families. Long ago the kingdoms came into an alliance to face a past enemy. That alliance held fast for many years, though the kingdom's kept their independence. Eventually, as other kingdoms came forth on the national stage, the Kingdom decided to formalize their kingdom as Callora. 

Each kingdom in Callora is allowed to act on it's own accord, and bring a proposal to action to the other kingdoms in Callora. If three fourths of the kingdoms agree, Callora acts as a whole. If any kingdom in Callora is threatened or attacked, the other kingdoms of Callora will respond in kind. The current ruler of the kingdom represents it to the rest of Callora. How that rule is decided is left to the kingdom itself. Truly, the kingdom's only are known as Callora in times of international strife. 

### Culture & Social Classes

The kingdoms vary slightly on laguz acceptance, but in general they have a neutral stance on laguz. While there's no outright segregation in the kingdoms, some kingdoms are less tolerant than others. Still, a crime is a crime so the worst Laguz usually have to put up with is insults or pranks. That said, there's currently a wave of sympathy going through the nation as laguz refugees from the southern pennisula work their way up to Callora. More people are accepting of laguz at the moment because of it, even those who have been residing in Callora all their lives. 

Something common to all Callorian kingdoms is their symbol of alliance. Different in every kingdom these seals, objects, or crests are given to those who are vouched for by the royal family of a Callorian kingdom. Having one is enough to travel freely in Callora, and having multiple is a sign of someone whose done great service for the Alliance. Wynne's chieftain has one of each symbol; a symbolic sign of the bond between the Alliance and Wynne. It's common that royals that become close within the Alliance share their symbol of alliance, and anyone who married into a Callorian royal family will have that family's as well.

### Military

While Callora has a sizable army, (2/3rds of the Eraia) it is made up of the armies of each kingdom in the Nation. Each kingdom supplies and trains their own army. In times of war, the kingdoms in Callora join together to form a large army which works towards goals set upon by the nobles of Callora. In most historical cases, these are defensive goals. While the individual armies that make up the Callorian army are firmly allied with each other, they are trained separately and this occasionally causes miscommunications on the battlefield. In the same vein each kingdom has their own morals and culture, sometimes causing divides in the heat of battle. 

The kingdoms of Callora have between them impressive amounts of Infantry and Calvary. The kingdoms that border the sea also have small Navys, which combined is larger than the Wynne Navy. Despite the varying training methods between kingdoms the soldiers of Callora are well displined even in the combined army. Commanding officers of differing kingdoms respect each others ranks and rebuild the chain of the command as new officers arrive.  

### Trade & Economy

Trade is managed at the combined level for Callora. The *Tradeswind Guild* has representatives of every kingdom (usually second sons/daughters or the like) and manages prices, trade routes, embargos, and other such issues. Working for the Tradeswind Guild is a great position to be in, though frequent travel is involved. 

Callora exports horses, mined materials, fruit and vegetables from it's farms, and unique creations from different kingdoms. Some kingdoms have excellent tapestries, some pottery, and so on from there. Callora imports things of value such as spice and furs from the north. Callora has sea trade routes with Wynne and land routes with Theanovene. There are old routes in place between Eraia and Callora, but they are only used by independent traders and travellers.

### Foreign Relations

* **Wynne**: Callora has long had an ally in Wynne and intends to keep them so. They find Wynne to be quirky in practice and more than a little behind the times. They respect Wynne's relationship with the wolf laguz, and respect Wynne's strength in general. Callora may be the only other nation in the world to understand how much damage Wynne could do if they left their island home. 

* **Eraia**: Callora is well divided on Eraia. In the past kingdoms were allied with Eraia, and Callora has intentions of forming an ally of the nation. When Eraia turned around and attacked Callora, it provoked outrage throughout the kingdoms and war began. Now, decades after that original war, people are growing tired of the constant tension with the nation. No one knows what, but something must change.

* **Theanovene**: Theanovene is a trading capital and Callora is one of the primary sources of trade for them. Theanovene is very good to Callora and Callora the same. There is a health dose of professionalism in the relationship, both Theanovene and Callora know that were either to be attacked, the other would not go out of their way for them. That said both nations feel secure in their borders and openly enjoy their allied status with each other.

* **Dreca**: Callora is far less divided on Dreca than Eraia. Dreca's violent, militaristic march onto the continent made a terrible first impression to many kingdoms in Callora and their actions on the continent have not change that impression. Callora is paying close attention to the situation with Dreca and Eraia, to possibly make an ally of Eraia.
