*Dre-ka : Strength in Man*

## Ruling Class

**Type of Rule**: Militaristic Empire

Dreca is driven solely by their need to expand. With limited resources on their island, the current leader came into power with a small military group and a coup de taut against the old, peaceful leader. Now those in power are decided by the country's dictator, and the nation moves at his whim. The nation is now run by it's military, as the whole nation in a fervor for expansion and territory gain. 

## Culture & Social Classes

Dreca is country at the tail end of a massive change. A decade ago a man by the name of **Dryn Wulfa** exectued a coup de'tat on the government of Dreca. The old governing body was peaceful and statisfied with the small Island that made up Dreca's territory. However the people were upset, resources were declining and space was becoming limited. Dryn stood up with charisma for the sake of the people, leading the coup de'tat to change the nation and improve it the only way they could; by taking space on the continent. The last decade in Dreca has been a blur of technological and military advancements, leading up to their recent invasion of the mainland a few years ago. 

Dreca has become a controlled country. Dryn Wulfa has control of the media and information flow in the country. He has burned books, calling them relics of the old peaceful ways. Dryn uses propoganda to encourage his platform, which is expansion onto the mainland, taking the land rightfully owed to Dreca from the *Norash* (Dreca slander for northerners). His leadership skills are second to none, even after a decade the country continues to have a constant drive for the war. This is in part from Dryn's villianization of the mainland kingdoms, calling them the theives and squatters on the land that's Dreca's by right. 

Children as young as 12 are being pulled into the expansion effort of Dreca. They spread flyers, run errands, and apprentice themselves to tradesmen, doing whatever they're able to do for the war effort. While children are not asked to do anything close to labor, in Dreca kids are working for the good of the country earlier than in other countries. 

Dreca is heavily reliant on fish for their diet. What little space they had before invading the mainland was overhunted a long time ago. Fishing and farming is almost exclusively their diet. Dreca is home to many exotic fruit and plantlife, due to it's southern positioning. These exotics have made their way into the trading markets at Theanovene recently.

A minor caste system is forming in Dreca under Dryn's rule. Military officers are high class citizens, followed by soldiers and then those that work to support the soldiers directly like medical officers and engineers. Respecting those closer to the war effort and Dryn himself has become an unspoken rule. Soldiers and officers are starting to become above the law, as they're the enforcers of it. Abuse of power is coming a real problem in the cities. 

Foreigners are extremely rare in Dreca. Given no nation in the outer world is happy with the Drecian culture, if a foreigner is in Dreca it's as a prisoner. There are rumors of Dreca using prisoners as slave labor to the war effort, but no intelligence group can confirm that. When on the mainland front, Drecians are cruel and arrogant to other races, a side effect of the propoganda used by Dryn to promote the war effort. It doesn't help that Dreca had limited interaction with other races before Dryn's rule either. 

Anyone's property can be taken for the war effort in the new Dreca. Dreca lacks much in the way of material traditions, due to Dryn's removal of the old traditions for his own. A few war traditions have been forming. Warriors who do exceptionally well in a battle are rewarded by their general with the general's armband (which serves to mark him from his allies on the battlefield). The armbands are tied around the hilt of the warrior's weapon. Another tradition is tearing up the flags of a conquered city. Pieces of the flag are divided between all the members of the war party, again fastened to armor or weapons as markers of their skill. 

Dreca's occupied cities are not happy places. The cities are under martial law, with soldiers running the city. The people who did not flee the area are required to work for the good of Dreca, often harder that Drecians themselves. Those people also are not considered citizens of Dreca and are denied some rights, often at the convinenice of the Drecian occupiers. 

Dreca is lacking in religion. They believe only in the power of the swords they swing. This has not endeared them to Eraia. 

## Military

Well equipped, well trained, but less in number than any other Nation, Dreca's army is powered by two major factors. It's fervored warmonger culture and it's wyvern riders. Dreca's wyvern riders are the primary calvary and main force of their army. Wyvern's are native to the island and are tamed by Dreca. Between dive bombing dragon claws and their mounted warriors, the wyvern riders are a nasty force of the fied. The only saving grace is they operate mostly independently on the battlefield, unable to perform complex formation without years of training like Wynne's pegasus knights have or a way to communicate in the air. 

Dreca's infantrymen are skilled and savage. While not organized in a sense, Dreca's men move in a chaotic flow through the battlefield, slaying all that stands in their path. They lack large calvary presence due the limited space they had under their control at the start of the Dreca-Eraia war and have yet to build it up. Dreca has an impressive Navy, originally fishing ships converted to carry troops or cannons. That's not to say they don't have warships, Dreca has produced a large number of military seacraft in preparation for combat on the main land. These warships not only carry men, but can allow Wyvern's to land on them. 

## Trade & Economy

Dreca has one export, mined precious metals from the mountain range stretching across their island. Dreca imports almost anything, having limited resources available on their islands. All their trade routes are over the sea, being an island nation. 

## Foreign Relations

* **Wynne**: Dreca has some respect for Wynne and sees them as a potential ally. They believe like them, Wynne has limited resources and deserves a place on the mainland. If Dreca can get Wynne to understand that, they feel Wynne's warrior culture will compliment their own. 

* **Callora & Eraia**: Callora and Eraia are the enemy to Dreca. They are the mainlanders who deny Dreca it's resources, lands, and rightful place at the top of the food chain. 

* **Torshan**: 

* **Dwyr**:

* **Rocnas**:

* **Theanovene**: Dreca has two opinions about Theanovene. The first and less important opinion is that Theanovene is also crippled in it's expansion efforts. While Theanovene has no interest in expanding beyond it's city-state, Dreca feels they must want to expand the same way they do. The second, and primary, opinion is that Theanovene is a dedicated trade city that can provide Dreca with the resources it so desperately needs. Dreca doesn't want to anger Theanovene while Theanovene will trade with them, mostly to not lose access to the resources Theanovene can provide. 

## Settlements & Places of Interest

* **Q - Hestim**: Hestim is the only Drecian built town on the mainland. Characterized by two large towers with large openings for Wyverns to land. Hestim is a bare bones town, currently the offloading point for Drecian military assets on the mainland. There are very few non military residents in Hestim. 
* **P - Seria**: The largest Kissaelain city before Dreca occupied it. Barely a city, the warm savannah and lack of large forests makes teracotta houses the norm. Most buildings are single story with roof access, though a few larger ones stand out against the rest. There are no paved streets, and furnishings are often sparse. When Dreca occupied it they took over what little comforts the city had for themselves, leaving the Kissaelain to scrap by with the bare minimum. 
* **R - Haland**: One of the twin Drecian cities. Brick homes are common in Haland and the streets are tightly packed. The city as a whole feels tight and cramped. There are no parks and no open spaces, every inch of space is used for buildings. The only open area is the Grand Manor, the home of Dryn Wulfa.
* **S -  Locta**: The older of the twin Drecian cities. Built before Dreca learned how to pack their limited space well, Locta's buildings are mismashed, the streets aren't consistantly sized, and the whole city feels dark. While Haland isn't a wonder of the world by any means, it's leagues better than the slum that is Locta.
