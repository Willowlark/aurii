Ferre is located on the south western island called Verrel. Verrel is dominated by Hilia and Laine Lakes, making the island almost hollow in nature. It's southern location makes it warm and comfortable. Verrel is mostly rolling hills with forests at the north and south ends. Verrel's lowlands are often flooded, very little exists in the valleys as it will be washed away with the next major rain or heavy storm at sea. 

Ferre has existed as nation longer than any other on Aurii. The Kouneli people have existed on the island since Lyarlel created them there, during the Age of Gods. Their remote location and status as one of Lyarlel's creations meant they were ignored during the Battle of the Twin Gods. While they only had a fledging civilization at the time, it was a far cry from the haphazard status the mainland races found themselves in. 

Ferre continued to exist peacefully on Verrel, unaffected by Aurii at large. This proved their downfall on the Night of Broken Burrows, the day when Eraia invaded the nation. Not prepared for war, Ferre was completely occupied. While the Ferrians remain under Eraian rule to this day, they strive to keep their true nation alive in any way they can.

Ferre is the home nation of the Kouneli, a race of rabbit like Laguz. Ferre is needless to say, not discriminatory towards laguz. Even after being invaded by Eraia, the Eraians that live or visit the island know better to comment on Laguz negatively in a nation full of them.

Ferre architecture is dynamic and rolls with the hills it's built upon. Buildings are mostly wooden in nature and are frequently multiple stories built into an incline. Some even include sections dug into the hill itself. Ferre has no roads to follow,  owing to the hilly nature of their land. There are well worn paths, but asides from that the land of Ferre is swath with green grass. Home built in the lowlands (usually those related to sea trade) are built on stilts as an attempt to avoid flooding. The stilted homes and lack of roads make Ferre look like the buildings were simply grown from the ground with the beauty of the island untouched. Ferre smells earthy as well, which some dislike but it's praised as one of the greatest things about the island by the Kouneli.

Magic isn't native to Ferre. The first use of it Ferrians saw was during the Night of Broken Burrows, where it was used against them in the invasion by Eraia. Magic got a bad reputation due to this and even today magic is looked down on as a shortcut in Ferre. Ferrians insist anything that can be done with magic can be done by hand better.
