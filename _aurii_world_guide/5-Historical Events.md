## Recent

* **10**: Dryn comes to power in Dreca.
* **3**:  Laguz are attacked by Dreca.
  > In the last decade, Draca has taken to war with the Empire of Eraia. The first step Draca took was to get a foothold on the continent and to so they attacked the southern pennisula, territory of the cat and tiger Laguz. Despite calls for aid, the surrounding countries did not send substanial aid, for a variety of reasons. One of those reason was underestimation of Draca's military might. Their wyvern knights were an unexpected threat that chewed holes in the Laguz milita. As Draca's ships landed on the shore of the southern pennisula, the Laguz were forced to either flee to other countries or be annexed into Draca's new settlements. 

  > Draca doesn't treat them terribly well. Theanovene is sympathetic to the loss but holds to it's neutral status. Eraia, now at war with Draca, welcomes the Laguz and encourages them to join in the war. Laguz are well accepted in Eraia at the moment, as fellows in conflict. Callora accepts the Laguz refugees and is sympathetic to their issues as well. However, the aristocracy isn't united on the Laguz's plight as a reason to start a war. The treatment of the Laguz refugees has proven to be no different than the already residing Laguz. 
* **2**: Eraia and Dreca go to war. 

## Callora-Eraia War

The Callora-Eraia conflict was effectively the first war for the continent. Eraia started by sailing to the south, conquering the much simpler nation of rabbit laguz on the south west island and expanding along the southern peninsula. Theanovene had not formed at this point.

Eraia, seeing it could expand into the relatively barren plains of the south anytime, put it's efforts towards the kingdoms to the north. (Remember, they aren't actually Callora yet.) This war was crusade; a way to spread Lylalel's light to all and enlighten those unwilling to accept. Fighting began in the west. 

Callora (the Kingdom, not the nation) saw kingdoms being steamrolled by the Eraian crusade. Eraia's military was a super power, well trained and motivated by Lylalel. Individual kingdoms didn't have the size or strength to compete with the well armed Eraia.

Callora came to the aid of <kingdom name here>, helping repel Eraia in a single victory for the kingdoms. Callora then appealed to every kingdom in the north. Together we stand, together we fall. A summit was held with leaders of each kingdom, in the kingdom of Callora. The Alliance was formed there, under that mantra. 

The combined militaries of the kingdoms had their own motivation; every kingdom lost brought Eraia closer to their own. The Alliance blossomed and grew stronger. It has more land and people than Eraia when combined, which gave it a chance to catch up on Eraia's military assets. This drove the conflict into a real war, not a march of victories for Eraia. It continued for years.

Eventually the losses were piling up on both sides and Eraia called for a ceasefire. Eraia had the upper hand in negotiation, still being stronger, but they were graceful in terms because they knew Callora could muster more might if they were given more time.

After the dust settled, the Alliance was left without it's unifying purpose. Another summit was held and the kingdoms discussed. Many thought Eraia would be back. Others enjoyed the security of unity. Some didn't. It was decided the Callorian Alliance would stay together as a unified group of independent kingdoms. A few refused (most prominantly Theanovene, a small city state that insisted on neutrality during the war) but most signed on to form the Alliance we know.
