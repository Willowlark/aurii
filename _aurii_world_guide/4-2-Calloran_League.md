*Cal-lor-ah : Legacy and Loyalty* 

## *Note on the City-States*

*Each heading under Callora will have a section for Callora, Torshan, Dwyr, and Rocnas. These are four city-states that take a primary role in the League politics. Each has the backing of nearby smaller city-states that align with the larger state's political viewpoint. The four groups will have some detail to each of them, rather than for two dozen smaller city-states.*

## Ruling Class

**Type of Rule**: Confederacy 

Callora is a union of city-states formed by the city-state of Callora during the first crusade of Eraia. The League persisted after the crusade and is more commonly recognized as a whole than its parts. It is not without internal political struggle, but in the international sense Callora acts as one. Most city-states are monarchies in the League.

### Callora

Callora is ruled by the original Calloran royal family that founded the league originally. The family still commands much respect from the League as a whole due to their forefathers forming the League in the first place. However, the royal family is not the same as it once was and the current generations are quite content using their legacy to command power rather than earning it themselves. 

### Torshan

Torshan has had multiple internal revolts over the last century. The current royal family has only been in power three generations, and barely that. Torshan is a passionate nation, one easily prone to following a charismatic leader in their objectives. This volatile culture is what sparked so much revolution and while Torshan garners respect for its size and ability to keep functioning mid revolt, it's royal family has the least respect of the four nations due to it's lack of legacy. *It's commonly said that if you need evidence of the passage of time, look for the changing of the seasons or a new king in Torshan.*

### Dwyr

Dwyr was originally founded by a tyrannical dictator of a man, who only passed power down to his family because of his death. His family, drunk on the power they were given on a silver platter, devolved into chaos and debacle making a revolt easy. The family that took over was a family of mages, and they brought order into the nation. This family continues to be in charge of Dwyr. Dwyr's royal family are all accomplished mages and scholars, and rule in a lawful, logical sense. The nations around Dwyr adopted some level of Dwyr's adherence to order, but in more rational degrees. However, Dwyr is always fair to it's neighbors and speaks for the whole's best interest in the League's councils, so it's neighbors don't mind the very rigid Dwyian family.

### Rocnas

Rocnas is furthest from Callora nation and Eraia, and has always felt separate from the other areas in the League. Originally they joined the League as to not be surrounded entirely by this new nation due the southern mountains, they have always been quiet in regards to international politics. The city-states around Rocnas are heavy on farms and fishing and they are content to keep the status quo of farming and trading their crop. The royal family of Rocnas is almost as old as Callora's, and they set the conservative tone of the Rocnas region. Rocnas is more often than not non vocal on issues in the League, though for a few topics (particularly isolationism) they are quite steadfast. 

## Culture & Social Classes

### Dwyr



### Rocnas



## Military

Membership in the League states that all city-states of the League have the protection of the assets of every other member's military strength in addition to their own. By joining the military of your city-state, you sign on to protect the entire League as a whole. This doesn't extend to policing internal issues, but at any international level each city-state is expected to send the bulk of their forces at the council's direction. In defense of the League, the League as a whole has the primary command of any military asset of it's members. 

The League does not require involvement by all members in offensive military operations. City-states wishing to make an offensive gesture are to bring it forth to the council. Other city-states may pledge support at that time, or choose to not involve themselves. The council also decides if the League blesses the military action; without the blessing of the League any counter attack to the attacking state(s) will not get the required military support stated above. In the League's history, no city-state has gone through with offensive action without the blessing of the League. 

The League has a variety of military assets due to their size and spread of people. When gathered together, the League can muster a force comparable to that of Eraia. However, the entirety of the League's military might has not been gathered since the first Eraian crusade. 

### Callora

Callora contributes two primary assets to the military. Callora's plains are home to many herds of wild horses and Callora's city-states has long mastered the art of cavalry battle. Cavalry trained in Callora is some of the best in the world, and while Callora doesn't produce quantity, they produce quality. Callora the city-state also has a tactical school of renown. Most tacticians in the League train there. 

### Torshan

Torshan provides man power and weaponry to the military effort. One of Torshan's primary exports is weapons and armor, so in times of war their considerable population is put to work smithing enough equipment to arm every city-state. That same considerable population fills out the ranks of the League army as well, though due to the high turnover rate of leadership in the city-state, there are few with experience in Torshan's ranks.

### Dwyr

Dwyr, unsurprisingly, brings magical power to Callora. Dwyr is most hesitant to involve themselves in combat, but when they do their mage corps are ruthless. Dwyr primarily uses anima magic, though rumors of a dark magic specialist group do exist. Dwyr's non magical military forces are as small as possible, and are only used for internal policing. 

### Rocnas

Rocnas has a large navy to protect their fishing ships from pirates. As the other areas of the League lack any considerable naval force, Rocnas accepts that their navy is more of a group asset. The city-state has a naval academy as well. Rocnas has limited group troops, and prefers to keep them in the city-state. 

## Trade & Economy

The Calloran League trades with Theanovene and Wynne heavily. Theanovene provides items available from Eraia and recently Dreca, while Wynne provides items only available in the northern nation. The League is the primary source of spreading Wynnite items across the world, as Wynne refuses to trade with anyone else. Tentative trade agreements have been set up with Eraia, but they haven't taken off due to old political tensions. 

International trade is usually brokered through Callora, being the oldest city-state and founding one. It's not a popular arrangement, but works. 

### Callora

Callora exports include foodstuffs and horses, as well as mined materials from it's mountains. 

### Torshan

Torshan area primarily exports weaponry and smithed items. Popular imports are rare foodstuffs and southern items. 

### Dwyr

Dwyr is the largest source of Tomes in the world, it being their primary export. Books of all kind tend to make their way to Dwyr, and Wynnite goods are also popular. 

### Rocnas

Rocnas primarily exports foodstuffs, and imports newer technologies. Farm equipment, magic, etc, Rocnas tends to be behind other nations in development and chooses import over internal development. 

## Foreign Relations

**Theanovene**: Theanovene, as a neutral state, is on good terms with all the Calloran political groups. Theanovene is fond of the League, they consider the League to be the most peaceful group to work with. 

### Callora

* **Wynne**: Wynne continues to have respect for the Callora of old that united all the city-states, even if Callora is no longer living up to that legacy. Wynne considers Callora a good ally. Callora is quite used to Wynne, even if they like the Naissankari a bit too much for Calloran taste, and treat them like anothe member of the League.

* **Eraia**: Callora is both terrified and curious of Eraia. Callora wants Eraia as an ally, but knows Eraia hasn't changed much from the nation that crusaded against them in the past. Callora is unsure if Eraia will want to attack them or befriend them tomorrow, and royalty is content to leave figuring it out to their children.

* **Dreca**: Callora considers Dreca the enemy it doesn't know. Dreca's forceful march through the lower continent scares the city-state, enough that Eraia looks friendly in comparison. Dreca doesn't acknowledge the League's independent parties and doesn't care differently for Callora than any other area. 

### Torshan

* **Wynne**: Torshan's support of Dreca has alienated them from Wynne. Wynne considers the states in this region traitors to the treaties set down centuries ago. Torshan has accepted the loss of Wynne, feeling it's still safer with Dreca.

* **Eraia**: Torshan considers Eraia the greatest enemy of the League. Eraia has tried to destroy them before and the moment they see the chance they will try again. 

* **Dreca**: Torshan considers Dreca a tool they can use to gain independence. By allying with the nation that seems set to conquer the mainland, they will have secured a place as an ally and not a conquered nation. They see the military might of Dreca, being southern most Calloran region, and respect Dryn Wulfa's power.

### Dwyr

* **Wynne**: Dwyr and Wynne maintain the traditional relationship between their nations. Wynne gets tired of Dwyr, especially the more rigid nations, but there's is mutual respect between the nations. Dwyr and Wynne mostly interact over trade, rather than personal interest.

* **Eraia**: Dwyr is neutral on Eraia. They acknowledge they have reason to be concerned by the theocratic empire's apparent urge to crusade, but also realize times have changed from the first crusade. Dwyr also respects light magic study as a whole, and even Lylalel's religion. Eraia has been known to send envoys for mutual study and learning to Dwyr countries via Theanovene, and value the nation's focus on magic.

* **Dreca**: Dwyr feels Dreca is a rash, angry nation sparked by Dryn Wulfa. Dwyr leadership respects Dryn for his tactical prowess and charisma, but fears he makes decisions poorly and is a danger to anyone around him. The fact that the nation was so easily swayed by him is a further black mark on them in the eyes of Dwyr. 

### Rocnas

* **Wynne**: Rocnas and Wynne maintain an amiable relationship. Rocnas being the most rustic group of the Calloran parties helps them bond with the wild Wynnite tribesmen. Wynne is not a fan of Rocnas's isolationism preference, but lets it slide as Rocnas holds up all requirements set forth by the League treaties.

* **Eraia**: Rocnas considers both Eraia and Dreca to be the "boogeyman". They exist but are distant enough from them they are inclined not to care about them. Rocnas was barely affected by the first Eraian crusade and this left them with the idea that they are safe in their corner of the world.

* **Dreca**: Rocnas considers both Eraia and Dreca to be the "boogeyman". They exist but are distant enough from them they are inclined not to care about them. Rocnas was barely affected by the first Eraian crusade and this left them with the idea that they are safe in their corner of the world.
