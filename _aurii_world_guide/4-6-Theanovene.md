*The-ah-no-V-ine : Neutral location; neutral stance*

### Ruling Class

**Type of Rule**: Geniocracy

Theanovene is ruled by a council of Guild leaders, expert traders, and other intellectual leaders. Theanovene has a charter that was put in place at the cities founding to be neutral and trade focused. The council meets to discuss both city management issues as well as new issues. Each new issue is dealt with in the spirit of the original charter and any jumps in logic from the charter are added to the Amendments. 

### Culture & Social Classes

Theanovene is a melting pot of a city and the trade capital of the world. The city is controlled by a wide variety of guilds that cover pretty much every trade one can imagine. Anyone who wants to make a living as tradesmen would be wise to start off in Theanovene.

Theanovene is a massive city and everyone is on top of each other. Everyone knows their neighbors and the neighborhood children and they watch out for each other. Depending on the guild, parents work late hours to put their hours in for the guild and neighbors keep an eye on children. Theanovene is strict on children working and doesn't allow children to do anything but be children until age 16. 

Theanovene has farms on it's outskirts, though they're often dedicated to exotic trade fruit, spices, or other such products. Theanovene has no fresh fishing market, and limited hunting spots. The farms of Theanovene do keep livestock for food production in addition to trade. These facts leave Theanovenians diet up to what is coming through the markets at the time. Living in Theanovene is the best way to try all of the foods of the world.

Theanovene's entire culture is high paced and influenced by it's trade center role. People walk quickly, talk quickly, and do their business with purpose. Time wasted is money wasted. This is can be tough for foreigners to get used to at first. The markets in particularly are very high energy and it's easy to get swept into the crowd. 

Theanovene is strict about respecting cultural differences. This comes into play a lot with Eraian guests. Anyone who doesn't abide by the cultural habits and rules of the guest is immediately dismissed and reprimanded later. In Theanovene, being host is an honor and very much a privilage. One is expected to go all out for the sake of their guest.

Theanovene is neutral to every other kingdom in the world. They insist on being so, stating that all they wish for is continued trade with the civilized nations of the world and the continued peace of it's city. In the past the council has threatened removin a nation from it's trade routes if the nation continues to act up. Theanovene is aware this eventually not going to dissuade an opponent, but for the time being they run with that as their plan. Because they are neutral to every other country, Theanovenians often get to travel every country in the world as part of their routes. Signing on with  Theanovene trade group is a great way to see the world. It is also a great place to study other cultures; Theanovene keeps excellent records of other countries cultural rules. 

Theanovene guilds are an authority on their subject area. Guilds make most of the jobs for Theanovene and manage most of the internal affairs of the city. While signing up with one is a process, once entered the guild will back you through all sorts of trouble. 

### Military

Theanovene has no military force. Members of the city sign up for a militia of sorts, one that handles internal affairs and criminal offenses but Theanovene refuses to act outside their own borders. Theanovene uses threats of trade embargo to prevent attack rather than a standing army. That said, individual residents of the city (particular Sages who have their studies in the city) are more than capable of fighting off large groups of invaders. Theanovene has many individual assests that help protect it in place of a formal military.

### Trade & Economy

Trade capital of the world, due to it's central location. Theanovene is right in the center of the only land route crossing the continent, which also serves as the hub for dozens of roads going in every direction. All roads, routes, and trails lead to Theanovene in the central continent. Theanovene trades in everything, but as far is it's own exports it exports magic and other forms of knowledge as well as exotic fruit and spices.

### Foreign Relations

* **Wynne**: Wynne is untapped potential to the council of Theanovene. That said, it's hard for Theanovene to trade with Wynne and Wynne isn't helping from their side.

* **Callora & Eraia**: The northern and southern trading partners of Theanovene. Theanovene keeps to a professional relationship with the both of them, knowing one day they may resume hostilities with each other.

* **Dreca**: Dreca's violent ways aren't making anyone happy in Theanovene, but a vocal few have made it clear that Theanovene is to be neutral to other countries in ever way. There's currently a push to make an amendment to the charter of Theanovene, backed by political pressure from Callora and Eraia, but it's never been done before. No one on the council wants to take the responsibility of changing the charter.
