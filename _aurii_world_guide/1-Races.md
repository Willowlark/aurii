### Human Regional Differences

* **Wynne**: Wynneites are tall and stocky. While not pale, they have lighter skin due to the cold climate in Wynne. Their hair colors are typically lighter shade, blonde being common with brown a close second. Facial hair is common for men. Eye colors fall on the dark side of the spectrum, deep blues and browns.

* **Callora**: Callora has the most variety in their kingdoms. Almost every trait is represented in Callora, from skin to eyes to height to build. 

* **Eraia**: Eraians have light to olivish skin tones. They tend to be tall and thinner, with black hair as a primary trait in the country. The occasional straw blonde crops up here and there. Facial hair is rarely seen on Eraians. Eraians have dull eye colors in all of the normal color ranges.

* **Theanovene**: Theanovene natives are lightly tanned and tend to be a few inches shorter than other races. Bright eyes are a common trait and there is no standard for facial hair among Theanovenians. 

* **Dreca**: Drecians are light tanned with light hair colors, blond being the most common. They have bright eye colors and while shorter than the northern humans they don't lose out in build. Facial hair is common in Dreca. 

### Manakete

Manakete are a race that originated from Dragons that stored the majority of their power into an object known as a Dragonstone, taking a humanoid form for the rest of their long lives. Nowadays, *Pure Blood Manakete* are rare in the modern era, what Manakete are to be found are *Mixed Blood Manakete*, children with at least one parent with Manakete blood. It has been centuries since a true dragon has walked Aurii, which has left almost all living Manakete as mixed blood. 

Manakete live thousands of years, a trait inherited from their draconic origin. Despite having such a long life span, Manakete have trouble procreating in that time. The transformation from base dragon form to base humanoid is jarring for the body and leaves Manakete with near inferitility. It can take decades for an Manakete to conceive. 

Their physical appearance is also slow to age, even at 1000 years a Manakete can look like a teenager or younger. A Mankete's humanoid form is weak even by human standards. Manakete use a stone, unique to them, to transform into their original, dragon form. In their draconic form Manakete's can fly, have thick scale armor, breath fire or another element, and fight with tooth and claw. 

Prolonged exposure to their draconic form can be hazardous to a Manakete's mental health. When separated draconic power comes back into a Manakete from it's dragonstone, the power and instincts can be too much for the now humanoid mind. Transforming many times in a day or for hours on end can leave a Manakete rattled, dizzy, and nausous. Almost like an addiction, resuming the Manakete form can aleviate the symptoms though it's a temporary fix. If a Manakete is too far gone to return to it's human form, it will lose itself in a rage, destroying indescriminately and indulging in it's draconic instincts. Because of that threat, most Manakete only transform in times of combat. 

Manakete's look physical similiar to humans. The only tell tale trait of a Manakete, asides from the Dragonstone they must be carrying, is their pointed ears. Even such a simple fact isn't common knowledge, as Manakete are terribly rare. Many live in solitude with only their immediate family, while others are protected in small villages that revert them as minor gods. 

### Laguz

Laguz are a race of humanoids that hae the ability to transform into a beast form. Physically they will show a few of their beast form's traits in their human form, often ears and tail. They may also show other beast traits such as enhanced smell or sight in their human form. Unlike Manakete, Laguz transform freely and there is no side effect to their transformation. (Though it's common for a Laguz to pick up habits related to their beast form even as a human.) When transformed, a Laguz has all the features and abilities of the animal they transform into. Like the beasts they transform into, Laguz's coats can vary wildly. Laguz hair and eye colors also vary like the beasts they transform into, but usually matches the coat color they have transformed. There are three variants (or *Tribes*) of Laguz in the realm, each with a cooresponding beast form, detailed below. 

Laguz and humans can have children together. Children of a mixed couple are always laguz, and physically are the same as any other laguz. Any half breed label would have to come knowing who their parents are.

Throughout history, Laguz have been treated as second class citizens. Historians have varying opinions on why, be it out of fear of the Laguz's ability, jealous or something else. No modern Kingdom allows slavery, yet in the past every Kingdom considered Laguz slaves a normal thing. Laguz originally occupied the entire south eastern section of the continent, yet the land that they owned was reduced over time to just the southern most pennisula. Laguz are now treated far better than in the past. That said, some people still think of Laguz as more beast than man. 

#### Cat 

Native to the southern pennisula. Now scattered to Callora and Theanovene. Lithe and agile, they make up for their small stature by being hard to hit and fast with their attacks. The tribe is more culturally varied than the others, meshing well wherever they go. 

#### Wolf 

Native to **C** in the north. Wolves are heavier hitters than cats while they aren't tigers. Wolves still have claim to their ancestral home and are very traditional to their old ways. They mesh well with Wynne culture and have long been respected by the Wynne.

#### Tiger 

Native to the southern pennisula Now scattered to Theanovene and Eraia. The most inheritantly powerful tribe, it didn't help when Draca came calling. Prideful as a race, the loss of their home territory is a sore point to every member of the race.

#### Rabbit 

Rabbit laguz originally had full claim of the south western continent before it was annexed by Eraia. The rabbit laguz split evenly down the middle, some joining Eraia as second class citizens, some heading out to other countries. However there's rumors of a rebellion <!--Rabb-ellion--> in the back alleys of the island. Rabbit laguz, unlike the other races, aren't the same size as their animal counterpart. Rabbit laguz are large, almost the size of tigers. The have long, powerful front and back legs.
