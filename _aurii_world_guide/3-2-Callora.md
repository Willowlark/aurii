Callora is the central kingdom in the *Honoril Alliance*, containing large grassy plains and lush forests. Callorian territory is generally accepted as follows. The western boarder is *Cahyrst Mountains* and the eastern border the road leading south from *Caford* to *Theanovene*. The southern border in the west is *Loecan Pass* which it shares with *Eraia*. Callorian territory on the eastern side of the *Llanfyll mountains* ends just before Theanovene. Callora is located in a temperate climate, though winters tend to be slightly worse than summers. Callora's forests are deciduous and the leaves fall from the trees every winter, leaving the forest eerie and barren.

Callora came to be when a large group of people left the city that would become the capital of Eraia, *Lyall*, due to the Church's oppressive influence on the city. That group split into three smaller groups, the one lead by *Helmann Sige* forming the town of Rosin. Helmann died a bachelor and a con artist by the name of *Avir Callora* took hold of the town. While Avir was lazy, his people were not, expanding Rosin into a city of it's own and soon into other towns as well. Avir left the Kingdom in the hands of his first born son and this started the Monarchy in Callora.

Laguz are seen as second class citizens in Callora, particularly by the upper class. No laguz are native to northern Aeldun and the first experience Callorians had with them was with Kissaelain refugees from the Eraian Crusades. These refugees left an impression that laguz (Naissankari and Kouneli as well, despite only Kissaelain entering the Kingdom) were plains savages, dirty and with little to their name. Despite some Kissaelain and even a handful of Naissankari settling and living in Callora, the upper class continues to believe laguz are nothing more than animals. The lower class is less aggressive to laguz than the upper one, but still would choose another human over a laguz. 

Callora is a monarchy, ruled by the original Callora family line. The king has full control of the Kingdom and answers to no one else, though there are various officials he differs tasks to in the kingdom, such as generals and minsters. The number one responsibility, as passed down by the original Callorian king *Avir Callora*, is "always have an heir, so we never lose the position I placed us in". Many of the Callorian kings have taken this to an extreme and it's normal to have 3rd and 4th princes of Callora in a generation. (It is also fairly normal for Callorian kings to have a second wife, though some have been monogamous.) The Callorian line's leadership varies by generation, some kings such as *Hiram Callora* (the king who started the Honoril Alliance), brought the Kingdom to new heights but others did nothing but eat with the rich and tax the poor. The former tend to refer to the latter with the phrase "Too much of Avir in their blood" privately.

Callorian towns vary depending on what class you find yourself in. Outer areas of the city are weathered small homes and businesses predominantly made of wood frames and hardened mud/twig walls. These cramped together buildings are where the lower class calls home. The tight quarters are made up for with community and access to the services other members of that community provide. Some farmers live on their farms, giving them more room, but the town environment appeals to many others. Streets in the outer areas are all dirt due to constant foot and animal traffic, mud after a rainstorm or heavy fog can be a problem because of it. What few open spaces exist in these areas are dedicated to gatherings such as cattle sales and town meetings. Decorations are rare in the lower class areas, everything very practical and as it needs to be. Still, there's a lot of personality to be found in the lower class parts of town between bustling taverns, good natured people, and chaotic energy in town. 

As one gets closer to the upper class areas, brick and stone buildings become the norm, larger and with more space between them. These homes mostly belong to land owners and those with other upper class professions. They're carefully put together to be aesthetically pleasing so the owner can show the home proudly to other upper class Callorians. They're also built with this in mind, many open into a large great room designed for entertaining. Streets in the upper class area are cobblestone, avoiding the mud that forms in the lower class areas. The most impressive homes of the upper class residents are multiple stories tall. The occasional public garden dots these areas. Businesses in the upper classes areas are exclusively fine dining, artist studios, tea shops, and other high class places. There are frequent patrols by guardsmen in the upper areas and, given you belong, it's a very safe place to walk around. Evenings are filled with nobles flitting between restaurants and homes gayly. 

Clothing choices in Callora also varies by class. for the lower class simple wool clothing is dominant. While simple, there is a large variety due to the amount of clothing Callora exports to other nations, giving even Callorian peasants freedom to expressive themselves with their outfits. Upper class Callorians have as intricate outfits as they can manage, and wear them as much as possible to ensure to the rest of the upper class their status. Robes with delicate embroidery, complicated dresses, and fur lined jackets are all the rage and the speed at which the Callorian nobility eats up new clothing designs is tremendous.

## Culture

There is a distinct divide in the way Callorians live based on there economic class. The upper class of Callora almost entirely land owners who rarely need to do anything themselves to make more money. This started with the first nobles appointed by Avir (friends of his), and continued down the line until all the land worth owning was owned by someone. Because taxes on their land formed the entirety of their income, the upper class Callorians took to showing off to each other just how much money they had from their lands. Just owning land wasn't enough, land close to the castle in the center of the city became most valuable, then it became about having multiple stories, then the exterior, then the gardens... The competition between the grandest and most current nobles is fierce and constant. The crown encourages this off the record, the frequent clothing and goods fads that the nobles go through keep the economy thriving. 

Nobles are generally good to those who live on their land. There's always the threat of a family moving to another noble's territory, and the more skilled peasants on one's own land the more money the noble can keep in his own theoretical pocket; but the most important reason the nobility treat their people well is so that they don't look bad when compared to how other nobles treat their peasantry. The crown also secretly propagates this trend, early Callorian kings treated people well and keep the nobility from getting too corrupt via being the defacto trend setter. The fact that this trend never changes is a conscious decision on the part of the Callorian royal family. 

Nobles in Callora tend to be swept up in political games and the current trends more than the actual goings on of the world. The royal family places into this as well, some more so than others. The royal family is at the center of all trends, and anything they do becomes popular with the nobility. Some Callorian kings have milked this for attention and to expand the royal treasury, others have used it to enact sweeping policy reforms by getting the trend nobility to think it's the newest trend. Nobles that see through this guise are quickly brought into the fold and if they choose not to support the royal family the trends quickly turn against them until the noble is driven to bankruptcy and social suicide, returning their lands back to the royal family who appoint a new line of noble in his place. 

The life of a noble is controlled by the trends, but some things remain constant. Balls and house parties are a given, unspoken requirement for every noble house. Any noble who doesn't host others at his or her home must have something to hide and becomes the talk of the town. Miserly nobles don't tend to do well, due in some part to social judgement but also because they'll be unable to keep up with the ever changing trends without spending a fair portion of their income. 

Nearly all of the nobility lives in the center of town, surrounding either Rosin's Castle or the Royal family's home at the center of each other town in Callora. These areas are more well maintained as part of this. Nobility has every option to live on lands they own, but the royal family technically owns all land in the upper district and living in either the lower class areas or outside of town where they own land is judged heavily by the rest of the nobility. It's not uncommon to have vacation homes outside of town, manors to visit in the summer or to hide children away at during events, but if one does not have a fine home in the upper district they're quickly shunned out of all social circles. 

Between the nobility and the lower class are Knights. The Knights of Callora are an organization overseen directly by the Callorian royal family. Originally formed as a sort of private army for the royal family in case of revolt, the concept of the chivalrous knight who lives and dies for his lord spread through the nobility's grape vine and the Knights soon fell into that role. Knights of Callora serve King before all else, but nobles who sponsor homes and perks for a knight tend to gain the loyalty of the knight. This practice took off and most knights outside of the capital spend their time in service to a noble rather than the King. 

Knights are mostly independent, seniority and experience being the only ranking between those knighted by the King. They have squires which serve under them, at the most half a dozen who are effectively servants of the knight. Squires sign on with a knight hoping their master will sponsor them for a full knighting, as a reward for peerless service. Many squires give up before their knight considers them worthy. Callora's royal family tends to test sponsored squires heavily so knights are reserved about sponsoring their squires until they're sure that the squire will succeed. A failure by a squire is a black spot on a knight's record.

The Knights of Callora have a code of conduct they follow. They do indeed serve the Callorian royal family to the last, and unofficially the nobility (particularly the one paying the knight's bills) as well. They serve the kingdom, expected to right crime when it is found and serve as a role model for all people's. They are to be peerless warriors, able to be called to defend against invaders at a moment's notice. Much like the nobility, other knights tend to keep the knights generally on the same page. Older knights enforce the code on younger ones, and by the time the younger knights are mentoring the next generation the values are well ingrained in them.

Callora is an agricultural hub for much of Aurii. Callora has more farmland than any other nation and grows anything they can. Vegetables and fruit are abundant and available, as is wheat. Hunted and gathered food stuffs such as berries, mushrooms, and non livestock animal meat are far rarer (and of course, always in style for the nobility). Callora has many beef, chicken, and pork farms which make up much of the meat choices for the standard Callorian. Beer was first brewed in Callora, and there's an annual festival celebrating it.

*Note: Rating represent Callorian owned assets, not the Alliance's*

Callora's military assets are at a minimum, originally put together for internal policing more than anything else. Before the crusades the standing Infantry saw little actual combat and spent most of their time carting drunks off to jail. Even after the Crusades, Callorians looking to serve the the crown as troops are rare. The tried and true goal of every foot soldier to be selected to be a squire of knight, which opens up the door for the squire to maybe become a knight himself. Knights themselves are the bulk of the Callorian's fighting force, all trained in mounted and unmounted combat. Lances and swords are the weapons of choice for the knights, bows are seen as cowardly for a knight to wield. Knights social standing depends on their combat achievement so they frequently train, more so than the standing military. While they frequently compete off the battle field for the adoration of the nobility, Callorian knights are loyal to one another when fighting and work together well. 

Callora has a magic college in Rosin which has produced the Crown Magicians, a small unit of combat mages. Most mages in Callora are not interested in using their abilities for combat but a small group do practice combat magic and answer only to the King himself. The Crown Magicians don't hold a candle to Dwyr's magic users and the unit tends to stay in Callora, to prevent against magical internal attack. 

Callora's Navy exists mostly to defend fishing ships and trade routes from pirates. During the Crusades there was a large push to increase the Navy, as Eraian ships sailing around to the northern shores of Callora were the only way Callora could be directly attacked. Most of these ships didn't see action, the Crusades being mostly fought on land, and now Callora has a surplus of combat ships available for use. This has worked out well in regards to the Alliance, both Dwyr and Torshan rely on the Callorian Navy for protection of their own ships.
