# In The Beginning...; Pre Lylalel's Light

In the beginning, there was only Lylalel and Lyarlel, twin dragons of immeasurable power. Lyarlel, a creative force, challenged himself to produce things of beauty upon Aurii. First came water and mountains, after that came plants and animals. He prided himself in the natural order of all of his creations. The wolf ate the deer and the deer ate the grass.

He showed we had created to Lylalel, and she was impressed. She asked Lyarlel if she could add one element to the world he had created. He, loving his twin, agreed immediately. Lylalel explained then that the world he created adhered too strongly to the natural order, too much to the repeating cycle. She felt that what the world needed was a rogue element; something to pull the world from it's order, and push it back on the path. Lyarlel was skeptical of this, but trusted his twin. It was with this, that Lylalel created mankind.

At first, the dragons saw more of the same. Humans fell into the natural order, being killed by the wolf and killing the deer. Lyarlel was amused, and teased his twin. Lylalel bid her time, waiting for humans to reach their potential. Soon, they did. Their intelligence gave them the ability to invent, learn, and adapt. They began to defeat the wolf, despite Lyarlel's order to all things. Lyarlel admitted defeat to Lylalel in good faith. The humans inspired change in his work, and he found that beautiful as well. In concession, he consummated his twin's addition to the world by creating the Laguz; man that were able to take the form of beasts, truly a mix of both dragon's influence. He created four races, one in the north from the powerful wolves, one in the west from the unassuming rabbits, and two for the mainland who embody the felines that room it's plains.

The dragons watched the world from on high, letting it evolve on it's own thanks to the randomness of Humans. As man progressed though, it began to move around the natural order of things. With the invention of spear and fire, the wolf was no longer a threat to man. With stone walls, storms no longer displaced man from his home. Lyarlel grew frustrated. As Lylalel said, these humans pulled away from the natural order but they never returned to it. It changed and modified his world. Forests disappeared, mountains were disemboweled, and animals were permanently removed from Aurii. 

Lyarlel approached his twin and told her of his frustrations. She beseeched him to be patient, to see the whole of Aurii come to it's conclusion on it's own. Lyarlel wasn't willing to listen to her. Lyarlel's art, his masterpiece was infected by these humans, and he wanted them struck from it. Lylalel stood her ground. The dragons took ethereal form, traveling the blooming kingdoms of the world. She showed Lyarlel how humans took after the two of them, how they create beauty like Lyarlel himself, and evolve and encourage change like Lylalel. Despite her show, Lyarlel was unconvinced. A new race could be created from their initial mistake, he told Lylalel, one that could evolve without taking control of the realm they dwell in. Lylalel stood her ground.

Already on the mortal plane, the argument between the two dragons came to a head. Shedding their incorporeal forms they appeared before their creations, before all of creation. Lyarlel took things which came under his domain, the land, sea, plants, and animals and brought them against the Humans. Lylalel's creations, sorely outnumbered in what was truly Lyarlel's realm, were given a sole gift to defend themselves with. Lylalel gave them understanding of the language of the gods, a runic language that produced magical effects powered by the twin dragons themselves. She told the humans that their understanding of this language would fade by the end of the generation; to protect man from it's influence. 

Humans, wielding true magic through both twin's powers, faced off against Lyarlel's creations. Lyarlel was enraged to see what Lylalel had give the humans. He knew the infection to his world would only use their dragon's powers to further destroy his creation, and would not hear of Lylalel's insurance it would fade from memory. Lyarlel challenged his twin, in the skies above the humans and animals. He swore that if Lylalel was so determined to corrupt his world, he would do so himself. Lyarlel placed a seed of his own power, fueled by rage and hate and an endless drive to return the world to the pristine state it once was, or dust trying, deep with in Aurii. The seed took root, pulling deeply from his power, creating leylines all across the realm. From these rivers of magical power came corrupting influences that ensnared the life on Aurii. Demonic, magical beings came to be from the animals and humans the leyline's power touched. These beings attacked humanity, striving to fulfill Lyarlel's one goal of cleansing his creation of the virus his twin created.

Lylalel and Lyarlel clashed above Aurii in a battle that would inspire religions around them. Below humans fought desperately against Demons and the rest of Lyarlel's influence. Magic permeated the air; human's spells powered beyond Lylalel's expectation by Lyarlel's leylines and demons moving about, bringing more living things under the influence of the leyline's corruption. The battle lasted weeks, the dragons never stopping and the humans nearly destroyed. Seeing this, Lylalel decided there could be only one right way to end the conflict. She could not allow the enraged, wild dragon her brother had become to continue to create things in this world. 

Lylalel created a seal of her own; one that encompassed all of Aurii. She tied all of the dragon's power to the seal; such that both she and Lyarlel would be contained with in it, so long as it remained unbroken. The seal purified the leyline's dark influences, preventing the corruption from coming through the leylines. The gods of the world were now sealed within it, preventing the corrupt leylines spawned from their infighting from destroying Aurii. Humanity was left on it's own, the world returning to the order Lyarlel was once so proud of. 

Somethings didn't go as planned, however. Runic magic was to fade from the world after the generation Lylalel bestowed it to; removing magic from Aurii once and for all. The knowledge of the magic did fade, none could remember how to read or write in the language of the gods. Yet due to Lyarlel's leylines seeping magic into the world (Lylalel's Seal only cleansed the magic, it did not prevent it from reaching Aurii) the magic itself still existed. Not only that, some written records were retained in the world, due to the leyline magic protecting them from Lylalel's planned erasure. Most things on in Aurii were destroyed during the fight between the dragon gods, but many of the ruins had clues or writings about the now forgotten language of the gods. All due to the leylines, magic stayed on Aurii, ready for humans to learn slowly over centuries of effort. 

## Elbia

* Elbia: pre light era? Maybe a city of manakete? Had magic available to them? Allows for Elbia to be the ruins that can explain magic 


# The Birth of the Nations; The Era of Lylalel's Light

Humanity, post the Intervention of Lylalel, was mostly gathered in the western portion of the mainland. Any prior civilizations, particularly Elbia, were lost to Lyarlel's machinations, reclaimed or destroyed by nature. The humans left had survived a war between literal gods and were left in awe of the greater beings. They knew nothing of the dragons beforehand, and very little of them from the Intervention itself, mostly the names of the dragons and the terms of the magic Humanity had been granted. Most stood behind Lylalel; she had granted them magic and sacrificed herself to to protect them from Lyarlel, so she must be good. 

## Wynne

Some however understood Lyarlel's message; that humanity had gone too far and were losing respect for the earth beneath them. Those who felt this way were in the clear minority, and the followers of Lylalel weren't receptive of the alternate view point. In fighting broke out in the fledging towns between those who condemned Lyarlel, and those who understood him. Eventually it came to a head; a woodcutter by the name of *Beornn Frith* rallied those who supported Lyarlel's view behind him. Rather than combat the followers of Lylalel, he and the people he inspired packed up their lives and sailed north, far from the supporters of Lylalel. They curved around the mainland and found themselves on the northern island of Aurii. 

The humans under Beornn laid claim to the southern shores of the island they called *Gawic*, finding the unsettled island to be a good home for them to build a nation which respected nature as it is, not a tool for man to control. They built the foundation for the nation Wynne under Beornn's leadership. Soon the fledging town Coudell attracted the attention of the Naissankari (wolf laguz) native to the island. A handful of skirmishes broke out between the two races, the Wynnites unable to communicate with the Naissankari who refused to treat with the humans. Over time an unspoken peace was formed; the Naissankari had their own boundaries in the woods which Wynnites were to respect. So long as the Wynnites did not cross the boundaries of the Naissankari land, the Naissankari would tolerate the Wynnite presence on Gawic (ancestrally called *lumisade* by the Naissankari). 

Wynne, peace with the natives brokered, grew at a relaxed pace. They respected the land, as Lyarlel wished them to. Over time, the image of Lyarlel became replaced with that of those who fell to the harsh climate, and the animals who taught them how to survive in it. Rumor spread of a man who was lost in the woods in a snowstorm, only to have a spectral wolf guide him home. This was simply a Naissankari doing a good deed, but it helped Wynne shift to a belief system that was spiritual in nature. They came to believe in guardian animals who are reincarnations of their loved ones, guiding them to survive. They came to believe nature itself was the god, rather than a dragon that fought another over nature.

Wynnites respected strength, to survive in the cold climate they now call home. Along with their shift way from the dragon gods of old, they lost a sense of the divine. Instead the only powers that be are humans who had returned to nature. As there was no greater power in the world to compare themselves to, Wynnites found themselves ever challenging their ability to exceed human limits. Their leaders were the strongest among them, those who could lead and hunt and a rousing speech in the same day. 

The relationship between the Naissankari and the Wynnites was stable all this time, and was well on it's way to never changing. It did however change, when a young Wynnite man fell into a ravine during a powerful snowstorm. The man was in his late 20's, on a challenge to prove he has what it takes to challenge the current chieftain to various people in the community. In the ravine *Ror* found himself face to face with an injured wolf. A boulder had fallen on her leg, pinning her in the ravine alone. He helped the wolf, and he was then met with a beautiful woman with snow white hair. She was *Frostve*, the chieftain of the Naissankari's daughter. Neither spoke of their roles at home however. 

They huddled together, talked of different worlds and what it was like in the other's. The two fell in love over the day and a half they were stuck together, and only survived due to one another. The Naissankari came first, finding Frostve back in her wolf form. She told her people of how Ror saved her from a cold death and they helped him escape as well. They then left, leaving Ror only to wish to meet his love again. He returned to his own village, hailed a miracle for surviving the storm, and was given the blessing he wanted in challenging the chieftain. Before he did, he found his way back to the ravine... Only to meet Frostve, looking for him as well.

The two met frequently in the woods after that, bonding further. It came to a point where Frostve decided she would be with him, separate people's or not. She brought him before the Naissankari that very day, much to his surprise. It was dramatic evening, but Ror's passion for Frostve was apparent. He also was the first Wynnite to get the chance to explain their culture to the Naissankari, who found they had more in common than either had ever would have guessed. In addition to blessing the union of the two, Frostve's father declared that it was perhaps time for the Naissankari to introduce themselves to Wynnites. This was an equally dramatic affair, but with Ror speaking for them the Wynnites quickly came to accept the Naissankari. After all, the Naissankari were the perfect marriage of nature and humanity, how could they not be fellows to the Wynnites? 

From that day forward, Naissankari were welcome in the Wynnite lands and conflicts between the two ceased entirely. Wynnites, out of respect for Naissankari tradition, were only allowed to the Naissankari home Roren by invitation, though the chieftain of Wynne is always invited at least once to meet his peer. 

With the entire island now shared between the two cultures dwelling on it, the Wynnites set themselves to a challenge no Wynnite had ever succeeded at before. The capture of a pegasus, winged horses that were native to the mountains of Gawic. The creatures were always able to escape to Naissankari lands before, and the Naissankari lacked the tools to climb the mountainsides themselves. The greatest hunters and athletes from each culture joined together, making a public show of their attempt. It took better part of months, but the group were able to capture the first pegasus.

The pegasus was wild, untameable and absolutely not ridable. All of Wynne was about to give up on the beasts before a young girl happened to pass the pegasus. Whatever magic was at foot, it connected the two. The girl was able to not only approach, but ride the pegasus in due time. Over the last decade it was determined more pegasus would be willing to take to a certain rider, but only that rider. However, when bred the resulting pegasi were far more amiable to humans. They're still quite skittish of Naissankari, as they can smell the wolf on them, but bred pegasi are able to be ridden by more than just the one person wild pegasi happen to connect to. In the last few decades before the Eraian Crusades, Wynne put together a flying force of Pegasus Knights, a few squadrons of warriors riding upon pegasus back. It's a small force, barely a two dozen in number, but little can interfere with a pegasus knight's mission. 

## Eraia

TODO: Add note about Lylalel being drawn as a winged dragon

Those who stayed behind on the western half of the mainland (*Hagate*) were devoted to the worship of Lylalel, the dragon of light who saved them from the dark dragon Lyarlel. The first leader of the Church was actually a solider *Aldwyn Threda*, a man who lead his fellows in the *blessed generation* against Lyarlel's daemons and servants. He stumbled into the role, to be entirely truthful. He was the man dedicated to making a new home for humanity, one that would properly honor Lylalel's slendor. He lead the people in droves to the *Colme Cove* to the south, establishing a city on the cove's waters. This city would go on to be Lyall. 

Alwyn's own interests were in building monuments to preserve the story of Lylalel's defeat of Lyarlel for all time. Others came in around him, encouraging oral and written tradition as the rumor mill filled new facts about Lylalel. The city attracted followers in droves, and the larger the population the more the original story of Lylalel's coming warped into something larger and more complex due to different accounts, rumors, and in some cases even lies. Alwyn himself stayed on track, producing the first iteration of Lyall's beautiful cathedral from Onyx stone, mined from the mountains to the east. The Onyx stone became a trademark of churches built in Lylalel's honor. 

As the religion solidified and the city built itself up around it, some were unhappy with the result. Those who stuck with the worshippers simply out of promise of a new home after the old world was destroyed by Lyarlel loved the city of Lyall but found the increasingly rigid rule of the church to be too much. This moderate faction kept to itself mostly, a quiet thing to discuss with other members of the group. Another faction was far more vocal than they were about the Church of Lylalel which kept the moderate faction out of the eyes of the church. 

Those born after Lylalel's coming, and therefore not part of the Blessed Generation, wanted to know the secrets of magic. The Blessed Generation explained time and time again that gift was temporary, and they would be the only generation to use such magics. The tension between the aging Blessed Generation and the pro magic faction rose slowly but surely. The infighting between the two grew harsher, until finally a leader *Rida Winyeue* rallied all those that found Lyall's leadership to be corrupt and hording. With support from the more stable yet passive moderate faction, a rebellion was formed against the Church of Lylalel, Rida at the head. 

The rebellion lead by Rida was a harsh, week long affair. The magic of the Lyall leadership helped them keep control of the city, yet they could do nothing as the rebels gained support. At the end of the week, the High Cardinal himself came before the rebellion, seeking terms. Rida was insistent on access to the magic the Church was hiding away, but the leader of the moderate faction *Helmann Sige*, the base of her rebellion, undermined her. Helmann took a promise of supplies and being left alone by the church in return for his faction leaving Lyall for the north. Rida, outraged by the betrayal, was forced to accept a similar deal. Without the supplies the moderate faction provided them, Rida's rebellion would be easily squashed out. 

Well over a third of the city left Lyall in the follow week. Over half of those people went north with Helmann, and the remainder took ships south with Rida, swearing to return for the secrets the church was keeping from them. The High Cardinal *Gauwyn Folke* came before the remaining two thirds of Lyall's population. He spun a speech that would be remembered for generations, about how those loyal to the church are those truly blessed, and those who reject Lylalel's light simply must be shown the light. The speech would later inspire the Eraian Crusades, though Gauwyn simply wishes to rebrand the fledging nation as just that. It was during this speech the Kingdom of Eraia got it's name, coined by Gauwyn from some words in the language of the gods. 

While much of his true motivations, keeping Lyall together, were lost to time, Gauwyn would go down in history as the first Cardinal to 'bring Lylalel's light to the people, casting out those who rejected her' and 'blessing those who followed her, accepting all who would accept her'. This mentality became a gold standard for the Eraian people. As Lyall expanded and new members joined the clergy, a fervor came over the city. Soon the city would accept that their role in Lylalel's plan was to bring her light to all people, and if they resisted they simply had to be shown her glory. Eraia's military expanded from a token force to fall under the church's supervision, letting the church fund a force that could properly spread Lylalel's message the word around them. Eraia built themselves up, the fervor reaching all the way back to Gauwyn's speech driving them to become an impressive, powerful nation. Trisp and Estad were founded during this time. 

Eraia never forgot about the Blessed Generation, though the details of their blessing from Lylalel were lost to time. Instead, the church focused on how they could achieve the magic that the Blessed Generation had access to (The irony of this being Rida's reason from splitting from Eraia lost to time). Eraia had the largest collection of documentation from the Blessed Generation and scholars dedicated their lives to even find words from the language of the gods. It took centuries of study but Eraia was the first culture to access Light Magic, defining the category of spells as Renassiance Aurii does now. 

Soon Eraia's military strength was leagues beyond the young nation of Callora to the north, and the Kissaelain to the south. The fervor started long ago when Gauwyn unintentionally inspired the concept of a crusade, and now Eraia was ready to begin. 

## Callora

The moderate faction of the Eraia rebels traveled north. Unlike the people who would found Wynne, this group traveled by land. They made their way around the mountains, leaders such as Helmann Sige discussing what the massive of people were going to do with themselves. Some, true to the name, were quite moderate in opinion, just looking to live peacefully. Two other opinions formed as the rebels traveled. The first was from a woman by the name of *Cilia Lyne*, who felt rather than just separate themselves from the church they should do everything in their power to prevent some other theocracy from rising and taking power. She gained a fair amount of traction with the group. *Rousek Bomir* on the other hand took issue with any sense of order. He felt holding themselves to the traditional leadership roles was a major weakness, and fellow chaotically minded individuals joined him. 

As the people discussed what they wanted in their new country, Helmann, Cilia, and Rousek all realized there was more than enough space and people to split up. See what worked, see what didn't. They discussed in closed council, then proposed it to the collected people. The decision was unianimous, with everyone getting what they wanted. Cilia took those who agreed with her north west, to *Hagate Spire*, the pennisula at the top of Hagate. Rousek went east, nestling himself along the north side of the *Penmyrth Mountain* range, the eastern range standing opposite to the *Llanfyll Mountains*. Helmann's people stayed right where they were, dead center in the northern half of Hagate. 

### Etrina

Helmann's people built themselves up on many of the traditions once held by Eraia. Helmann served as ruler of the nation, though in his own era he was more akin to an overworked mayor. However the people were happy and the northern plains were prosperous to live on. The Northern sea provided fish, the plains were littered with deer and horses, and mining was plentiful from the Llanfyll Mountains. Horses became key to Etrina's economy, exporting the captured and tamed wild horses to the neighboring fledgling nations. 

Helmann lived a long time, but eventually passeed peaceful. He died a bachelor, never marrying, and it left the fledgling nation with a deliemma of who was to take charge. Panic built up in the new town before a former con artist stepped up. He spoke with a silver tongue and woo'd the lost people into supporting him running the town. It was a cushy job for *Aril Etrina* as the people of the town already knew what they were doing. He was a lazy leader, nothing compared to Helmann, but he kept things 'normal' for the people in town. Over time, Aril pushed that the kingdom would one day need a name, and he would be so humble as to give his own for such a grand purpose. It took, and Etrina became the name of the nation.

Aril had many children, with many wives. His final speech to the town was to tell them Aril had trained his first born son with everything he knew, and he hoped his son would guide them as he had. The people, par for the course, accept this and the monarchy was born. Etrina built up quickly, despite it's dubious leadership. Some of the Etrinian line were quite dedicated to their role. Others were as lazy as their ancestor Aril. In addition to the horses, Etrina's wide open plains lead well to farmland and Etrina became the largest farming nation on Hagate. Providing food and livestock set the nation up to be just as cuhsy as Aril would have liked. 

Etrina City itself grew large and impressive, full of people who enjoyed to rub shoulders with other well to do people. Those who followed Helmann's original image for the town, those who wanted to be left alone in peace, branched out of the city towards smaller farming villages nearby. Etrinian culture also created the concept of Knights on Aurii, warriors trained to serve a lord. (The Eraia counterparts were much too tied ot the church to fit the role properly.) These knights were tasked with the defense of Etrina and did so by building up cavalry units. Fox hunting was used as an exercise when training these new units, and is attributed to fox hunting's popularity today. 

### Dwyr 

Those who followed Cilia to the northwest found themselves wandering almost aimlessesly for months. Cilia informed them, time and time again, that the right place to settle would appear. They simply had to look closely. Finally, Cilia found her place. A ruin, left behind from before Lylalel's Light era, was nestled in the northern most mountains of Hagate, the *Anolf Mountains*. This ruin contained remnants of the language of the gods, and Cilia declared this as the best place for her people to settle. Reading a random word from the ruins, she named the settlement Dwyr.

Dwyr built up slowly but steadly. Cilia oversaw every building, every farm that was built with a grand plan only she knew. She set up a council of founding families, and governed as a member of the council. While she had the support to do whatever she wished with the blessing of the Dwyr people, she insisted that all procedure go through the council, on which she held an equal vote to all other members. She knew setting the precedence would keep the people of Dwyr following the structure she was building for them.

Follow them they did. Cilia's council and grand plan of building the Dwyr kingdom was a resounding success, even after her death. Dwyr was zoned for each family to expand with their own dukedom of sorts, with plenty of room for the resulting farms. There was little infighting as Dwyr expanded to a full fledged kingdom. 

Dwyr quickly took to education in a two pronged fashion. Dwyr educated everyone as best they could, as the more intelligent the mind the better the decisions could be made. Additionally, Dwyr studied the ruin they built their kingdom around extensively. Linguistic study colleges (to become magical colleges, after the discovery of Anima Magic during the Eraian Crusades via the ruin) popped up in each nation in addition to the more standard colleges of thought. 

Dwyr had limited land for hunting and farming and did quickly reach a maximum on farms. Dwyr's people turned the ocean around them on the pennisula to suppliment their food supply. Dwyr diet frequently includes fish. Dwyr also produced a sizable fleet of ships to do this fishing, making Dwyr the owner of the first navy on Aurii.

Dwyr has little in the way of military at this time, instead relying on Etrina's in the case of Eraian pressure from the western coast. As Eraia grows bolder, Dwyr starts to build a meager ground forces.
