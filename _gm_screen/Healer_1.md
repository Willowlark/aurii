excerpt: A Story of a Healer
---

# Healer

* **The World** The Minor Arcana King of Cups REVERSED, which means *coldness, moodiness, bad advice*.
  * Cold and Dead world, Nier flavor, Humanity is dying
* **It's People** The Minor Arcana Queen of Cups UPRIGHT, which means *compassion, calm, comfort*.
  * Those who are alive know this world is coming to close and are compassionate because of it
* **My Powers** The Minor Arcana King of Pentacles REVERSED, which means *greed, indulgence, sensuality*. 
  * The healing itself is greedy, it heals *all* wounds and for every second that it heals it erases relationships of the healee's loved ones. 30 seconds of healing is enough to fix a mortal wound, but erases all of the person's relationships. (The connection is gone, not 'forgotten')
* **Me** The Major Arcana The Lovers UPRIGHT, which means *partnerships, duality, union*.
  * **Arwen** has a partner **Hardock** who helps her deal with the guilt she feels about her powers. He's classically trained and covers small wounds to keep the time of the healing magic lower

## Finding a Party

* **A Group** of Outcasts

* **The Party is Distinct...** The Minor Arcana Nine of Pentacles UPRIGHT, which means *fruits of labor, rewards, luxury*.

### How did you Meet?

> The fire crackles as Arwen pokes it with a spare piece of kindling. She glances about the rudimentary camp she and Hardock have setup, nestled into the ruins of an old stone home. Nature has reclaimed everything but the stone walls, and even those are covered with vines and moss. This must have been a nice home, long ago. It's secluded from the ruins of the village, in a pleasant clearing in the middle of the woods. 
>
> There's another crack, but Arwen hadn't poked the fire again. She glances in the direction of the sound, spotting her partner return with more firewood. He motions for her to be quiet with a finger over his lips before she can say anything. 
>
> As soon as he's close enough to, he whispers to her, "I spotted torchlight in the woods coming this way."
>
> "It's rare to see people this far out from a settlement," Arwen whispers back. "The nearest one is Ledon and they rarely leave the walls."
>
> "Yeah... So I'm not sure if we're expecting trouble," Hardock replies, glancing back towards the edge of the woods. 
>
> "Well..." Arwen sighs. "They've likely seen the fire. Nothing to do but wave hello."
>
> Hardock flashes a tired smile, "You are braver than I, love." Arwen only smiles in return as he puts the firewood aside. She also spots Hardock placing the crossbow he has for hunting closer to their seats around the fire, even though he's trying to be sneaky about it. He's so very protective and it makes her smile.
>
> The torchlight Hardock is quickly visible, and it makes it way straight for them. "You we're right," Hardock says beside Arwen. She only nods, and soon the torchbearers come into view.
>
> They're a rag tag looking bunch, but very clearly adventurers. They are adorned with the various goods they've looted from castles, dungeons, and other relics of the thriving world. It's a mismatch of fur lined coats and rusted over armor, embroidered sheaths and muddy boots. The three of them doesn't seem hostile, by any sense of the words. Arwen and Hardock share a look then Arwen waves at the party.

---

* **The Paladin** - The Major Arcana The Emperor UPRIGHT, which means *authority, structure, control, fatherhood*. 
* **The Sorcerer** - The Minor Arcana Ten of Wands REVERSED, which means *inability to delegate, overstressed, burnt out*. 
* **The Priestess** - The Major Arcana The Moon UPRIGHT, which means *unconscious, illusions, intuition*.

### How do they treat you?

> "Hail and well met, fellow travelers. May we pass by you without harm?" The leader of the trio says, a man well into his 40s with a full beard and the cleanest armor of the lot. The large broadsword on his back remains sheathed and he doesn't reach for it, though his age is a clear sign of his skill.
>
> "Hail and well met. Please, pass by or share this place," Arwen replies. "There are no other clearings between here and Ledon, so lest you wish to sleep on roots this is the best place to camp."
>
> "That's good enough for me," the other, younger man says. He drops onto his bum without ceremony, shucking off his pack. "I barely get my spells back as it is, let alone if I sleep on a bed of thorns!" Arwen raises an eyebrow, now that he mentions spells she's sure he's a Sorcerer of some kind. The robes under his coats are of the Sorcerer's Academy in Sawold. 
>
> The woman of their party, dressed in cloth of the Church, looks down at the Sorcerer. She hasn't opened her eyes in any of the time she's been in the clearing, as far as Arwen and Hardock could tell. She says nothing yet the Sorcerer sighs and stands again.
>
> "Yes, Milady..." He grumbles, then he takes a blanket from his pack and lays it out before the Priestess. She nods, then slowly sits upon it. He turns to Arwen and Hardock again with a wry look upon his face. "Don't mind her. She's thousands of yards away in her mind. It is simply..." He flops back down, this time closer to the campfire. "Our job to take her where her physical body to where she truly is."
>
> "That sounds... difficult," Hardock says cautiously. "For what purpose does she travel in her mind?"
>
> It's the Paladin who responds from where he leans on the stone wall, "She finds relics of the world the way it was the Church would preserve. The boy and I are to protect her. She is... rarely present, and her death would be a loss felt by many at the Church."
>
> "That's quite the quest," Arwen replies.
>
> "Indeed..." The Paladin stares for a moment at Arwen, squinting as if she was backed by the sun. Arwen herself reaches over to Hardock, squeezing his knee. He pulls his other hand away from where it was inching towards the crossbow. 
>
> "Might you be... Were you at the battle of Greyditch?" The Paladin asks.
>
> "I... I was," Arwen replies. "I'm a Healer by trade."
>
> "A Healer?" The Sorcerer perks up, the glimmer of interest in his eyes. "Are you a trained healer or do you have the gift for it?"
>
> "Hardock here," Arwen pats her partner's knee, "is trained. I am... I have the gift."
>
> "Is it true it manifests differently in all those who have it? True Healers are so rare these days not even the Academy could tell me."
>
> Arwen looks away, biting her lip as she searches for words. Hardock cuts in to change the topic for her. "It is true, as is the heavy burden that comes with it."
>
> "I see..." The Sorcerer has the sense to hesitate about asking further. His party member fills the silence.
>
> "Might we offer to share our fresh game with you, if we may use your fire to cook it?" The Paladin asks.
>
> Hardock looks to Arwen, then nods to the Paladin. "Aye, That would be fine indeed." The Paladin flashes a gruff smile and begins unpacking his tools to prepare the rabbit that hangs from his pack.
>
> "And if I may... More survived in Greyditch than anyone expected, and I'm sure you're to thank for that," The Paladin starts as he skins the beast. "If you are free of obligation, might we be able to hire you to join us? As I said before, the Priestess's loss would be a blow to many at the Church and it would be a load off my mind to know we have trained Healers beside us on this journey."
>
> Arwen and Hardock share another look. Both know there's no other job to be had and this party seems to be honest with their intentions. The partner's coffers run low as well. Still, Hardock asks quietly, "Are you... up to it? After the last time?"
>
> "..." Arwen closes her eyes for a moment... then nods to her partner. She turns back to the Paladin.
>
> "We'd be happy to join you."

## The Dungeon

* **The Dungeon in** the Forest **is Distinct because...** The Minor Arcana Eight of Pentacles UPRIGHT, which means *apprenticeship, passion, high standards*.

### How do you know you're at the Dungeon?

>  The Priestess does not speak in two days of travel. Arwen doesn't force the issue. She's sure the Priestess has seen things that warrant such a retreat into her own mind. Hardock doesn't mind either, as the Sorcerer talks enough for all three of them. He grips, whines, and complains about nearly every challenge they face on the road. His most redeeming feature is that he truly seems to care for the Priestess, and he understands her in a way the rest do not. 
>
> The Paladin is as skilled as he looks, so nothing comes close to harming the party. Arwen is thankful for that. There was a single nicked cheek by a stray arrow, so Hardock handled that. The Sorcerer complained, of course. But he simply doesn't understand the cost of True Healing.
>
> The Priestess guides them deeper and deeper into the woods. The Lephea Forest is know for it's sprawling size so most go around it, yet the Priestess only goes deeper and deeper into its branches. Hardock asked after the first day where she was leading them to. The Sorcerer told him that she knew the way, knew it was safe, and worth traveling. It was not our role to question that. 
>
> The whole party knows where they were lead, when they get there. An elven village comes into view above the party, over one hundred feet up in the trees. 
>
> "How did they get up there...?" Hardock muses, stroking the stubble on his cheek. "I don't see nary a ladder or staircase anywhere."
>
> "Elves were resourceful... Probably why they all left for the east before when the world was thriving," the Paladin says gruffly. "Milady, is this...?" 
>
> The Priestess turns and nods once. 
>
> "And I presume..."
>
> The Priestess points upwards.
>
> "Foolish of me to hope for anything else, I suppose. I'm not much for heights."
>
> "Are... you expecting trouble? This is a village, is it not?" Arwen asks.
>
> "The elves left already, which means their villages have become ruins the same as the human ones we're all so familiar with," the Paladin says, dropping his pack to the ground. 
>
> "Typically, goblins," the Sorcerer groans before dropping his own pack as well. From both packs the men pull ropes and spikes. "The little buggers are fond of squatting." 
>
> "So... Up we go?" Arwen asks.
>
> "Aye, up we go," The Paladin nods. 
>

---

* **The Goal** to find an artifact **is dangerous because** The Minor Arcana Two of Cups REVERSED, which means *imbalance, broken communication, tension*.

### What have you heard about your goal?

> Arwen, the Priestess, and the Sorcerer stand, watching Hardock and the Paladin climb via piton and arm strength. The Sorcerer reassured Hardock he'd have a spell to catch him if he fell, though he was still hesitant on the climb. 
>
> "Do we know what is it is the Priestess seeks?" Arwen asks.
>
> "It's... a good question," the Sorcerer says begrudgingly. He reaches over the Priestess, putting a hand on her shoulder as he leans in. He stands there for a good moment, long enough for Arwen to question just what he's trying to accomplish, before pulling back. 
>
> "We're looking for the village schoolhouse. There's something there the Priestess wishes to see preserved."
>
> "I... see." Considering that's not much detail, Arwen continues, "Is it a valuable? A text or tome?"
>
> "She did not say," the Sorcerer replies with nary a glance in Arwen's direction.
>
> Arwen's impatience gets the better of her and her tone is harsh, "And we climb into the treetops on just that?"
>
> "Aye, just that."
>
> "..."
>
> The Sorcerer takes note of Arwen's expression and sighs. "We trust in her visions. Her mission is important to her, but she values us as well. She doesn't show it the same way, but I can guarantee you she does. She doesn't lead us to danger we can't handle, and we follow trusting her not to."
>
> Arwen looks between the Sorcerer and Priestess slowly. "I... can see how much you trust one another. I apologize, it's simply... a rare thing, to see such a bond these days."
>
> "Oi! Rope's are anchored, time to climb!" Hardock calls from far above them, putting a pin in their conversation.

* The Major Arcana The Sun REVERSED, which means *negativity, depression, sadness*.
* The Minor Arcana Nine of Swords REVERSED, which means *hope, reaching out, despair*. 

###  For Each, What danger presents itself? What do you learn?

> "I would not be surprised to find ghosts in a village this empty," Hardock says. He hovers behind Arwen, head on a swivel for trouble. Each hut the party passes they find abandoned as if it were the middle of dinner. Plates on tables, glasses full of wine, toys strewn about on the floor. Arwen hates seeing the toys like that. She's unsure if the others are affected as she is. She knows Hardock has sensed her distress, as he always does. 
>
> "Do... you think they truly left for the east?" Arwen asks after leaving another hut. "It looks more like..."
>
> "They fled, aye," the Paladin replies grimly. "Not too long ago either. I can't say from what, but there are no signs of a fight. Whatever it was, they got away before it could turn into a battle."
>
> "Or they submitted peacefully," the Sorcerer adds. The Paladin turns a glare on the younger man. "What? Tis the truth."
>
> "You're a tactless brat, you know that?" The Paladin sighs before resuming their march deeper into the village. They reach a hub of various paths, a wood carved statue in the center. Arwen thinks it's effectively a town square. They rest for a moment on the statue's base, tired after the long climb up. 
>
> Only a few moments pass Before Arwen hears something. 
>
> "Mama!"
>
> "Is that?!" Arwen leaps to her feet. "You all heard that as well did you not?"
>
> "Aye, but-" the Paladin says in an oddly placating way. There's no time for buts in Arwen's mind.
>
> "It could be a child left behind! We must hurry!" Arwen sprints in the direction she heard the cry. Hardock grabs his crossbow and runs after her, while the Paladin clambers to his feet in his heavy armor. The Sorcerer simply looks to the Priestess, then sighs.
>
> "It's not good," the Sorcerer says as he takes off along side the Paladin, the Priestess slowly taking up the Rear.
>
> ---
>
> Arwen checks the first door she finds, not a thing, then the next. With no toys in the second hut she moves on to a third to find a single doll on the floor, it's head peaking out from under the bed. 
>
> "Hello? Little one?" Arwen says softly as she steps into the room. "I speak no Elvish but I am a Healer and wish to help..."
>
> There's a rustling behind her, so Arwen turns. Clinging to the ceiling are two green, miniature humanoids with rusted blades and vile expressions. She shrieks as the two leap down, blades flying for her neck and arms. She dives backwards, hitting the bed with a crash. 
>
> "Arwen!" Hardock calls as he appears in the doorway. He raises his crossbow without hesitation, launching an bolt into one of Arwen's attackers. The bolt pins the beast to the wall of the hut, where it squirms wildly before falling still in death. 
>
> Arwen kicks the goblin while it's surprised, giving her much needed space. She quickly wishes she let it get closer when it uses the momentum of the kick to charge toward Hardock while he loads another bolt.
>
> "Hardock!" Arwen cries, and her partner manages to duck the goblins swing, it's rusty blade only skimming his bracer. The monster spins to strike again but it finds itself cleaved in two by the Paladin's broadsword. The Paladin steps into the room, looking for more goblins with the Sorcerer on his heels. 
>
> The Sorcerer waves a finger, the playful lights of magic dancing after it, before the lights fly off under the bed Arwen is curled up on. The lights draw out a third goblin, one that quickly leaps for Arwen. 
>
> "No you don't," the Sorcerer growls before a ray of purple light extends from his hand. The light hits the goblin and disintegrates it in midair. 
>
> "Arwen!" Hardock cries as he pushes past the Paladin. "Are you hurt at all?!" He fusses, checking her over.
>
> "I'm fine, I'm fine Hardock," Arwen says, pushing him away lightly. "And I'm... I'm sorry, everyone. I simply wanted to find..."
>
> "I understand," the Paladin says as he steps over to her, his chainmail clanking with every step. "I've done the same thing dozens of times. Tis... Not easy, to face the ruins of a place that was once so full of joy." He reaches a hand out.
>
> Arwen accepts, letting the Paladin pull her to her feet. "Thank you, Sir Paladin. Master Sorcerer as well." 
>
> The Sorcerer just nods, his hands shaking. "That spell took a lot of what little I have left." It seems the shaking isn't nerves like Arwen thought.
>
> "Isn't that... circuit burn out?" Arwen asks.
>
> The Sorcerer glares at her, shoving his hands into his robes. "I'll be fine. Just need a good night rest, which we never get in the wild." He makes his way outside. The Paladin shrugs before following. Hardock and Arwen share a short hug, then follow after their companions.

* The Major Arcana The World REVERSED, which means *incompletion, no closure*.

### The Final Encounter, What did you face and what was the outcome? Were you useful or useless?

> The Priestess stops at a fork in the treetop walkways. She points to a hut down one of the paths. The Sorcerer nods, turning back to the party.
>
> "That's the schoolhouse. What we need is in there," he says.
>
> "... There's more of the beasties, it appears they've made that their camp," the Paladin says as he studies the hut through a spyglass.
>
> "Makes sense. Seems to be the largest building here," the Sorcerer replies with a shrug. "We can handle it."
>
> "We all saw those shakes boy, you can't handle much of anything right now."
>
> The Sorcerer turns on the Paladin, furious. "You don't get to decide that for me, old man! I can do this job as well as any lump of muscle and a sword!"
>
> "I don't doubt that boy, but you haven't had the rest you need-"
>
> "I am, just! As capable of protecting the Priestess as you! I was the first one hired for this, not you!"
>
> "Son I wasn't doubting it, I-" 
>
> "Then be quiet and let's go." The Sorcerer huffs. He makes his way down the path the Priestess indicated, the Priestess herself at his heels. The Paladin turns to Arwen, a somber look on his face.
>
> "Keep close to him, will ye? I... worry about that boy."
>
> Arwen nods, and the three follow after the Sorcerer. 
>
> The Sorcerer himself has stopped at one end of a bridge that leads to the school house. "Goblins! I come to defeat you!"
>
> "He can't be serious," Hardock mutters, out of the the Sorcerer's earshot.
>
> "You'll see..." The Paladin says back with a smirk on his face.
>
> The goblins begin pouring out of the school house. There must be at least a dozen, though Arwen is having trouble counting on account of how fast they're moving about. Some have bows, but most wield rusted blades like the three they defeat before. The goblins, cackle and laugh at the Sorcerer while make obscene gestures at the Priestess. The jeers and taunts only full the Sorcerer's anger, which in turn fuels his spell.
>
> Wisps of white light appear at the end of each of his finger tips, pulsing with energy. He keeps his hands low and out of sight of the goblins, right until he says the finals words of his spell. He whips his hands forward and the wisps fly through the air, each blowing through a goblin's body like an arrow an apple. There's screaming and war cries as the goblins pull their injured into the school house. The Paladin looses a cry of his own and charges forward across the bridge, slamming into the schoolhouse door before it can close.
>
> The chaos that ensues deafens Arwen's thoughts. Hardock hovers around her, using crossbow as club and bow to prevent any Goblins from getting closer to her. The Priestess is nearby, coils of light forcing goblins back from her presence. The Sorcerer is casting more of his wisps, each severely wounding the goblins they hit. The Paladin leads the charge, his blade rending goblins into bloody pulp whenever they get too close. 
>
> There is a short moment in which Arwen thinks she won't need to heal a single person on this trip. It's broken when two goblins dive from the ceiling, much like in their first fight with them, separating the Priestess off from the group. The Paladin is pinned down on the far side of the room while Hardock is covering the Sorcerer and Arwen. The Sorcerers hands are a shaking mess and his face is pale. He tries to draw up magic but his hands won't still enough for him to cast the ruins. He watches as the goblins close in on the Priestess, closer and closer, before tearing his eyes away to meet Arwen's.
>
> "Heal the circuit burnout." 
>
> "N-Now?" 
>
> "Yes, now! She's in danger!"
>
> "You don't understand the risks yet!"
>
> "I'll take any risk!" The Sorcerer yells. There's the glimmer of tears in his eyes. "I understand the costs of True Healing are heavy, but I won't be able to live at all if she dies, please!"
>
> "..." Arwen braces herself. With tears in her own eyes, she nods. She reaches up to cup the Sorcerer's cheeks and lets her power go. Time slows in her perception. She swears she can hear a ticking clock as green envelops the entire Sorcerer's body, looking for the burned out circuits to repair. The True Magic is unrelenting, like hunting dogs after prey, tearing through his body looking for any kind of wound or damage. It is no precision instrument, every tiny scratch or scar must be healed to satisfy it. Arwen is no more in control of it than a trout the waterfall it climbs, she is but the conduit for it's release. 
>
> Every second that ticks by breaks her heart, further and further. Already at six seconds, she knows the Sorcerer will not come out the same. The burnout is healed in seven seconds, as is every wound he's suffered. Time resumes for Arwen and she blinks away the tears. 
>
> "Help her!" Arwen cries out, pointing to the Priestess mere seconds from being run through.
>
> The Sorcerer grunts. "Fine." Wisps fly out once again,  enough to hit every goblin left alive. Unlike before the magic targets the monster's skulls, shattering them instantly. As the goblins around her fall, so to does the Priestess, dropping to her knees and panting heavily. Arwen runs over to her, giving her an immediate once over.
>
> The Priestess looks up not at Arwen, but over the Healer's shoulder to the Sorcerer. The Sorcerer has taken to rifling through drawers and cabinets, muttering about components and loot. The Priestess turns to Arwen, her eyes open for the first time since Arwen joined her party. The golden orbs are shimmering, a single tear rolling down the woman's cheek.
>
> "I,I...I'm so sorry," Arwen sputters out. "He... said he'd take any risk to protect you, and none of us could have..."
>
> The Priestess places a finger over Arwen's lips. She nods once, a sad smile on her face. Even the forgiveness is too much for Arwen, her sobs renew in force. Hardock makes his way over to her, draping his arms around her like a warm cloak.
>
> "Why... Why the tears?" The Paladin says as he approaches. He kneels down, glancing for wounds on the Priestess and Healer.
>
> Hardock looks down at Arwen, in no shape to explain. He holds her tighter and turns to the Paladin. "True Healing comes with a cost, different to every Healer. For Arwen... her Healing uses the patient's feelings of love to Heal. The Sorcerer, he..."
>
> "Aye, the boy's protective streak was obvious from leagues away. Will it..."
>
> "It's gone. The memories are there, but the emotions behind them are gone."
>
> "..." The Paladin looks over his shoulder. "He's okay though?"
>
> "Aye. Healthy as the day he was born."
>
> "Don't..." The Paladin sighs, placing a hand on Arwen's shoulder. "Don't beat yourself up too much lass. He would have done anything for her."
>
> The Priestess stands, eyes closed once again as she makes her way to a cabinet. She moves past the Sorcerer, who grabs her shoulder.
>
> "Oi, Priestess. I get you're the client and all, but if you're so damn prophetic couldn't you have warned us about the goblins? This a lot of unnecessary danger don't you think?"
>
> The Priestess turns slowly to him, then nods mutely.
>
> "Glad you agree. Next trip you better prove why we're supposed to believe you're not going to lead us into another deathtrap, you hear?"
>
> Again, she nods. The Sorcerer removes his hand from her shoulder and she makes her way to the far side of the room. She opens a cabinet and pulls out what's inside. She brings it back over to the assembled group, revealing it to all of them.
>
> A teddy bear, lovingly stitches with elven patterns up and down it's fur rests in the Priestess's arms. It's beautiful craftsmenship... yet ruins by the rust dagger that was drawn through it. Half the stuffing is missing and the poor thing looks deflated. 
>
> "The... The Church won't want to display something this damaged...." The Paladin says quietly. The Priestess nods somberly.
>
> "So this was all for nothing," the Sorcerer groans.
>
> "... Aye, unfortunately, it was."
