excerpt: Brainstorming for Season Two Storyline

# Draft 1

1. A mist, thick as the clouds in the sky, begins to form in Callora. It spreads gradually, and no one consumed by the mist ever leaves. At the first this is mere coincidence, but towns, castles, cites disappear into the mist as if they never existed. The mist never wavers, no matter the weather. It continues to encroach on Laera and those enjoying a night of festivities know not the horrors that await in the mist. The mist contains monsters and magic unheard of in the realm and it swiftly overpowers and kills those trapped in it, or melds them with itself. The mist continues to consume even after a lucky escape, and soon the entire world has to face it's overwhelming power, even if they don't immediately understand to be afraid.
2. A flying castle. 
3. Elbia was buried for a reason. It rests on the sole portal to the realm of demons. It made magic around Elbia powerful, but the seal cracked over time and Elbia, in a grand show, was forced to collapse their own city to reseal it. The knowledge of the portal was guarded, yet rumors have made it out the world at large. Interested parties are making moves to uncover the portal and open it, believing Lyarlel/other demons will come from within when they do. 
4. The blood moon comeith. An astrological event is a catalyst to cause the dead to rise, leaving battlefields as havens for monsters out to avenge their deaths. These beasts can only be defeated by performing a legendary ritual which requires yada yada from so and so on the New Moon, else they will rampage for eternity. 

1. The faction of evil incarnate is the once living, and beings created of once breathing flesh. Resident evil tier monsters formed from a once human(s), and grunt soldiers of the dead. 
2. Creatures of the night, demons and devils in various shapes and sizes. Little in the way of magical effects, but faster and stronger than any mortal and bloodthirsty. 
3. Humans overpowered by a demonic spirit. Mostly human in power level, but also an innocent whose being controlled. 
4. Mortal men serving their lieges and commanders.
5. Manakete, the dragonkin of legend brought to the forefront to fight those who once oppressed them. 
6. Secret Lyarlel cult. 

1. A Laguz summoner in Callora has secretly taken over the kingdom. He's fortified the castle and is creating demons from the living citizens of the country and his creatures form an army to take over Callora as a whole. He is motivated a belief that humans are stagnating the natural evolution of the race by oppressing Laguz. He wishes to eliminate humans and laguz who ally with them to advance them human race to it's next form. **Foes: 2**
2. A man possessed by a greater demon. The demon is using the man's significant magical prowess and resources to create an army of his own, intending to march from Callora to Elbia to reopen a portal to hell. The demon is tricky and has obtained power politically, using it to get human allies and disguise his true intentions. **Foes: 3,4**
3. A elder manakete awakens from a 100 year slumber to find his only daughter sacrificed by religious zealots. Enraged, he makes to judge humanity for its worth and promises to wipe the race from the earth if he finds it unworthy, which he does. He finds allies in other manakete and Lyarlel's hidden cults, who feel the elder manakete is Lyarlel himself. **Foes:4,5**
4. The demonic mist itself; the core of the mist is a strange entity that wishes to all consume beings around itself. To find it's core one must find the original invoker of the mist, who is forced by the mist itself into a dungeon of the mist's creation. **Foes: 3**
5. Dryn Wulfa finds a powerful sword in the lost woods, one of demonic nature that bestows upon him strength for blood. With it's power he's able to make advances that armies could not, and he makes waves in his quest to conquer the mainland. **Foes: 4**
6. ~~Lyarlel is the final judgement of Lylalel's lands. The two work in an endless cycle, Lylalel creating and Lyarlel judging. Lyarlel is not an evil god, but he is a harsh judge and will never approve of the mess than human kind is now.~~
7. The cult of Lyarlel wishes to open a gate to hell, believe Lylalel unfairly banished their lord there millennia ago. An explorer has recently spread rumors of such a gate, deep under Elbia...

# Draft 2.0

**The Mist**: The mist is an entity, force of nature. It travels from world to world, consuming the world and the inhabitants. It possesses the people inside itself, hazing over their eyes. The mist is more powerful at the borders and has confusing properties. It either corrupts a person trying to escape, or if the person is smart enough, just turns them around endlessly. Visibility is something like 30 feet everywhere in the mist. Due to the magical nature of the mist itself, magecraft is easier within it. The power of spells can double or even triple in areas of mist, the denser the better. 

The mist has the power to consume the minds of those with in it. This is initially done by a person entering an area of such dense mist no light can penetrate. These can be mostly avoided by not going into banks of thick mist. When the person is completely cut off and only surrounded by mist, the mist enters them, filling them with itself. This is initially terrifying, but the pain and discomfort fade as the mist hazes their eyes and they fall into the the trance the mist keeps them in eternally. 

Alternatively, a corrupted can corrupt others. Corrupted individuals are referred to as Revenants. They have the ability to manipulate the mist into bindings and effectively tentacles. They use these to completely immobilize targets, before pinning them down and transferring mist from their own insides to the other person, via mouth. Additionally the mist can serve as reinforcement to a Revenant's physical attacks, making them stronger than the average attacker. The mist itself can also form obstacles in the form of tentacles and such. They usually aim to capture targets and drag them deeper into the mist.

Beings that have survived in the mist long term, long enough for the mist to transition to a new world, transfer as spiritual beings. There are few beings who have managed this, and they tend to be loners. The mist keeps them separated as well. They no longer need anything to survive, and float through the worlds the mist consumes. They remain (mostly) sane and can communicate with the current world's denizens, though they can do nothing to interact with them. These people call themselves Remnants, and are what coined the term Revenant. 

**The Goober**: A series of items designed to repel the mist, created by the races that came long before the modern races. IE the fire emblem. It creates a seal around the plane which repels the mist, unbeknowst to it's users. The seal has faded, hence the appearance of the mists. This takes the form of the sword in the stone which repels the evil. 

* Are the swords powerless without seal powers? *probably*

* Is the seal broken from the start? Yes. 
    - How is this made known? Afina's dad looks at the mountain shrine? Eraian one 'vandalized'?
* Swords must be remade. 
    * Do you need a part from the original swords to reforge?
    * forged in dragon fire
    * Blades only cut mist, don't hurt mortals.
    * Collect all original parts, forge new blades, use new blades to diffuse mist, drop in seal. 

# 5 Room Theory

```
1. Entrance and Guardian. 
2. Puzzle or Roleplaying Challenge. 
3. Trick or Setback. 
4. Climax, Big Battle, or Conflict. 
5. Reward, Revelation, Plot Twist. 
```

## A plot 

1. **Entrance**: The party is caught in the mist, and is directed towards a shrine. They get to the shrine and reclaim the a piece of the original sealing swords, which allows them to escape the mist. 
2. **Puzzle**: They must find information on the shrines, and learn that these weapons were forged centuries ago. However, they are now useless and need to be remade.
3. **Setback**: The players must travel and recover each the crest from each of the original swords to make new ones and find a manakete to forge the new blades.
    1. Cathedral shrine - *Revenants*
        - What if it's a Callorian country, not Eraia? West of G. 
        - A country that houses the sealing sword in it's capital, it's original purpose long lost. 
    2. Wynne Shrine
    3. Water Temple Shrine - *Traditional Dungeon*
    4. Elbia Shrine - *?*
    5. Drecian Shrine - *Go into woods, find sword missing, recover from Dryn*
    6. Find the Manakete Smith
4. **Climax**: With mist sealing blades they enter the mist to defuse it's hold on the realm, and clear the shrine's from it's influence. When the mists hold is weakened they can use the blades to expel the mist. This leads to a march into the heart of the mist in Callora; all to reach the cathedral shrine. 
5. **Twist**: The mist had awoke Lyarlel and Lylalel, and sealing it away gives the gods access to the plane once again. Lyarlel will scheme.
    - *The mist is a being with awareness, and knows of what you've done. Next time the seals break, it will truly destroy your plane.* 
    - *Dryn Wulfa was behind the whole thing, looking to use the sword's power in the war*

### A-1 Protect the King; Escape the Castle

1. **Entrance**: The annual spring festival is being held in Laera. With the bloom of the plants comes blooms of knowledge, so to speak. Afina has been called home, surprisingly, to serve as the organizer of the party, as her Father has been wrapped up in an important study all winter. The festival takes place in the grand hall of the castle, large enough for hundreds to mingle. Her father is late to the party, but otherwise it seems to go off fine. Discussion among the guests is of the mist phenomena that has covered northern Callora. 
2. **Puzzle**: The mist begins to seep into the room, coming through the floor cracks. A guest makes to leave, letting in a flow of mist. The bottom of the castle has already been filled. Foreign soldiers enter with it, wreathed in mist. They begin to accost party guests, making them Revenants. Guards encourage Afina and her friends to find the king, as that will be the safest place. Revenants try and hinder them as they travel the castle.
3. **Setback**: The King's room is mostly filled with mist. He shouts for the group to stay out. He says the answer is in Lune, in it's central shrine. He warns to avoid being consumed just as he himself is, the mist entering him.
4. **Climax**: The group now must escape the castle, as no where is safe. The first path they try is blocked by thick mist. 
5. **Twist**: The group meets a remnant, and gain more knowledge about the mists before they lose themselves completely in the travel. They'll need to navigate following Revenants, lest they end up in deep mist. 

## B Plot

### Prologue

Winter has passed.

* **Wynne**: Wynne has continued to observe the mainland's nonsense. Heralds from Dreca arrived on their shores recently, who were immediately removed from Wynne soil. They make no declaration of hostility towards either side, but state their territories will be fiercely defended. 
* **Callora**: Callora has been fairly stable in international dealings. Meetings have been held Etrina recently about gathering military assets however, and Callorain nations have been more conservative about people of power traveling out of the Alliance. Rumors have been swirling Callora is prepping to enter the Dreca/Eraia conflict, but no one can guess on which side. Laera is holding an annual ball that helds in the coming of spring, and the guest list is a tad larger than usual. The King has invited an eclectic group of people in addition to usual faces, mages and scholars of all kinds. When asked, he informed that they are old friends of his from his days as a researcher over a king that he would like to see again. 
* **Eraia**: Eraia had a major military success over the winter; specialist infiltrated a Drecian camp in the Kissaelain territories, gathering information and eventually stealing a Wyvern. The wyvern was flown to the capital, a resounding success. Eraia has been studying the wyvern to learn more about the creatures and possible counter measures. National morale is up due to the mission, though many call for the immediate death of the psuedo dragon due to a relation to Lyarlel. 
* **Theanovene**: Theanovene has continued to remain a neutral party in the Eraia/Dreca conflict. This has brought them into a delicate powder keg of situation with Drecian and Theanovene officials constantly arguing over Theanovene's loyalties. Theanovene has held it's ground so far, but everyone in the city is feeling the pressure from the warring nations to choose a side. 
* **Dreca**: When the Eraian mission to steal a Wyvern went off well, Drecian morale took a hit. The pressure on the front lines stagnated and Eraia was beginning to make headway before Dryn Wulfa publicly executed the Wyvern rider responsible for the loss. Dryn gave an empassioned speech about the weak links not representing the whole. The speech was inspirational, if a dark message. There is a stigma now to not be the weakest link, because the weakest link is seen not only as expendable, but should be expended for the good of the whole. 

### Entrance

**Callora** is removed from the international standings due to being consumed with mist.

### Puzzle

**Wynne**, after learning of the mist from refugees and the party, feels they can defeat the mist as the strongest nation. The culture of power and pride works against them and they don't know to have a heathy fear of the unknown mist.

The following things need to be preserved to keep status quo between **Eraia** and **Dreca**. Namely, the Theanovene neutrality is what keeps either side from making a large attack. To keep the two from going all out, party must find solutions to keep the peace while they travel. 

* Theanovene must be able to continue trade with Eraia and Dreca, despite the danger of the mist
* Neither Eraia or Dreca will surrender, but need to allow Theanovene caravans through no mans land to each other's country.
* Eraia and Dreca both won't settle for less than control of the southern pennisula.
* Much like Wynne, neither nation fears the mist. Eraia feels Lylalel will protect them, and Dreca will fight the gods for Dryn. 

### Setback (occurs around the blade forging time frame)

Theanovene can no longer supply **Eraia** or **Dreca** due to Mist danger to the caravans. The general populace of **Wynne** feels they can take the mist without the ancestors guidance. 

### Climax

**Wynne** attacks the mist from the north, either trying to defeat the mist themselves or with knowledge gleaned from the ancestral history that's far more effective. They join the party attacking **Callora**, which is now dense with Revenants and mist banks, to reach the last shrine (cathedral) which is in the heart of Callora. Meanwhile, **Eraia**, **Dreca**, and the mist all converge on **Theanovene**. The city will be wrecked by the end of it.

### Twist

Depending on who takes the most damage in the Battle of Theanovene, **Eraia** or **Dreca** has been defeated by the other and troops of the winner are occupying the other's cities. **Theanovene** is borderline destroyed. What people are left in **Callora** are banding together, the individual country lines disappearing in an attempt to continue to control any borders. (Leads to a restructuring of Callora into a handful of distinct countries that are no longer allied.) **Wynne** begins to make plans to take ownership of the shrines, considering themselves best suited to protect the swords.

# Draft 3

## The Party

Party held to strengthen bonds in Callora. Foreign leadership in attendance to show Callorian Unity to the world. 

* Dissent between the Council sects is well rumored and seen at the party. Easy to overhear whats going on.
* Special guests tell of legends and rumors to follow as a presentation in the magic arts.
* King Afrin gives an address, stating to 'eat well and prosper tonight' despite the Drecian war hanging over their heads.
* Guests are seen and can be discussed with, they have actionable rumors to explore if they can find people to do it.
* Eraia diplomat pulls Elfriede aside to ask for insider information to the Callorian Alliance, as it is 'of interest to the holy nation'.
* A political discussion goes wrong and two dignitaries leave in a huff after being talked down by King Afrin. He'll discuss to party that 'something needs to be done, this is becoming more common'.
* King Afrin is pulled away by soldiers, when following him party learns it's because the lead military coordinator of Laera has been captured by Dreca and Dreca has advanced close to the Callora border.
* When King Afrin leaves, Wynnite ambassador gives a call to arms that falls on deaf ears. He is quickly disgruntled and leaves. 

## Callorian Divide

Missions taking place in the various sects of Callora for diplomatic purposes. Includes espionage, diplomatic representation, conflict resolution, scheming, duels. King Afrin is the NPC lead, he and his council are making every attempt they can to root out the dissention in Callora as a whole and reunite the city states. 

* Torshan is colluding with Dreca, giving Dreca information on the proceedings of the Alliance discussions. Investigate the castle in Torshan, find evidence of the collusion and return without getting revealed, then use the evidence to cow them in the Alliance chamber.
* Rocnas is committed to isolationism. Go there, find out why and convince them otherwise, and if not them their allies. Allies can be convinced by villainizing Rocnas, getting into Rocnas will reveal their leadership has changed hands and there's a new, young ruler. His regent is making the calls for him. *Boo, cheesy but whatever I can adjust later* Convince Rocanas as a whole to trust Dwyr as much as they trust themselves. 
* Callora has basically forgotten they are the core of the Alliance in fear of being trapped between Dreca and Eraia. They need to be shown they are the same nation that formed the Alliance, via show of support from Alliance nations, show of power against Eraia/Dreca, history refresher, or outright duel. 
* Wynne is pressuring nations to go to war, and unintentionally fear mongering. Dissuade their ambassador from doing so, underhandedly or with show of promise from other nations. 

*TLDR all missions involve gaining sway with a sect. That sect can be positive or negative. Postive is harder to get, negative will come back to bite you (IE if it's discovered it causes a loss to sway). Enough sway on all sides, King Afrin convinces the nations to get their shit together.*

### Front

* Torshan reveals to the council that Dreca already knows about their goings on, and they should ally with them less Dreca turn on them. Dreca sends (with insider information) the perfect offer to sway other nations away from unity.
* Callora declares they've opened borders with Eraia in an attempt to gain them as an ally, alienating other kingdoms with their actions.
* Wynne decides to go to war without Callora, calling the Alliance cowards.
* Rocnas declares independence from the war, no if ands or buts.

**Impending Doom**: The nation of Callora splits into four sects, based on allies and plans for the war involvement. It is effectively civil war for Callora on top of the war surrounding them. *Laera probably gets outed for manipulation and attacked too*

## Dreca's Advancement

Missions against Dreca itself. Includes securing allies, gathering intel, target destruction/capture, commanding troops, big battles. 

* Getting Wynne to sign on for a logical war, and not one of 'charge'. 
* Getting Eraia to cooperate in plans despite them having their own mechinations, keeping Eraia from executing plans against Callora during the main plan, ensuring agreed upon spoils are given to both sides. 
* Infiltrating camps to capture Wyverns/Officers/the camp to inform the war effort on Dreca's movements and advantages.
* Acting on captured intel to cripple the Drecian war machine.
* Discovery of the slavery taking place in the Kissealain territories and using it to get allies, keep laguz as allies (they'll want immediate action that's not possible), and coordinate specific missions. 
* territory battles, difficult influenced by prior 'spec op' missions on that territories key points.

*TLDR Far Cry? With political aspects from keeping Wynne and Eraia as allies and keeping the populace motivated to fight (selling the war). Take out 2-3 targets in a territory, battle for territory, rinse and repeat. Missions in the divide secure more troops for Dwyr.*

### Front

* Border skirmishes begin, sending panic through Rocnas and Dwyr.
* Access to Theanovene is cut off by Drecian advancement. 
* Public support for the war is lost in Dwyr and the military is hamstrung. (laguz abuse reveal in here probably)
* Callorian nations make a snap decision (outside of the Divide front) based on current sway levels, cause Dreca here.
* Open conflict at this point. 

**Impending Doom**: Dreca wins the war. 

## Legends

Missions hunting down rumors and legends, sponsored by hopefully them being weapons to use against Dreca. Exploration, puzzles, travel.

* Finding what happened to the Dragons, exploring ruins, finding Manakete, finding out. 
* Following the legend of the sword in the mountain lakes, finding magic weapons.
* Getting back to Elbia and exploring, finding buried ruins sections, learning new magic that's powerful or learning the secret of magic (dark magic is traditional magic, not evil). 

*TLDR Probably a bad idea for a play by post*

**Impending Doom:** None really. Decidely side quests.
