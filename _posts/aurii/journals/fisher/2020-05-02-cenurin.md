You know, they called me the golden boy alllll through training. I may not have had top scores, but me and Sasha could outfly any of those future medal brains at the top of the score sheet; and we don't even have to mention my combat prowess. 

*"Who am I telling this to, myself? Drin, I know"*

All those professors never would have guessed I'd be accused of forgoing mission objectives. We struck a target, Cenurin. Small village, easy target. Took two runs to kite the town in flames. I got suspicious though, when there wasn't a single arrow or spell thrown at us when we came for the second pass. I'd believe we took them by surprise on the first run, but the second they knew we were coming.

So I did a recon loop, before a third run. There wasn't a single combatant. Just more of the animal people, most of which broke North as fast as they could. What were we kiting them for, if not to weaken a military force? 

Orders stated to eliminate all hostiles, and I didn't see a single bow, tome, or sword among them. I called the Wing off, called it mission complete. Gettleman didn't like that I guess, he brought up the retreating troops in the debrief and I got a damn earful. He apologized later, saying he didn't think anything of it. I don't regret it though, reprimand be damned.
