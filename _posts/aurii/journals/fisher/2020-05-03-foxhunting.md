excerpt: Gods I wish it was just the foxes...

God, I wish it was just foxes. Some enlisted was talking up a Callorian soldier in a Theanovene bar. Apparently a common sport in Callora is fox hunting, releasing a fox and a group of men on horseback chase it down and kill it. I can't say I'm a fan, but it only gets worse. The enlisted man started talking it up, saying how chasing down animals might be good practice. Bastard just wanted to kill some animals outside of regulations, but he's not the real dastard. 

Some officer decided it might be good training for the Wyverns to do a form of a fox hunt. I... didn't protest. When we got up in the sky... what they released wasn't a fox. One of the laguz people was released from chains and kicked off into the plains. The neighboring Wing and my own took off after it... 

Gods. I could have ordered my Wing, probably the other down... But I didn't. Sasha didn't dive, I couldn't have her be a part of this... Despite still being in the I could hear the scream, and I swear I see the laguz's face. 

I've been having nightmares, to say the least. 

*Maybe admitting it, at least here will let me get some damn sleep.*
