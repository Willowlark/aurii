# Notes

The undesirables are bought slaves who serve non combat roles in the military to “pay off their debt”, a quick process. Then they’re accepted as part of the land. Cloak and dagger is trying to spite this process, potentially the church. Sponsors a library in the military town that provides mages to the military leisurely, many more assist the town. Major trading point, and adventurers cycle through a lot, hence guild hall. Standing military protects the city, trade interests, emancipated beastmen, assists adventurers. Knightly order trains with and trains troops, making troops skilled. Knightly order is also reason for favor with aristocracy. Sometimes the army is referred to as the knight’s army. Lord member of the knight order, though retired from active work. Started this relationship.
