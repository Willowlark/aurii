# Appearance

Sona stands at 5' 8" with long blonde hair reaching to between her shoulder blades, coloring leaning slightly towards a platinum blonde. It lies straight naturally. She rarely ties her hair, preferring it down, but when she does she does a very low sitting ponytail. If she's inclined she'll also clip the sides of her hair together behind her head, uncovering her human ears. Her bangs similarly fall straight naturally though she keeps them parted to the side. Her faunus feature is a pair of cat ears atop her head. The fur on her ears is more golden than her hair, making them stand out slightly. She has green eyes, which have a sharp quality to them. Her human ears are pierced. Sona has a lithe frame. She is not particularly busty but does have a well proportioned, 'hour glass' figure. 

## Vacuan Outfit

Sona's Vacuan outfit starts with a [leather jacket](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/7e/61/76/7e6176db42ac0642ad4079fa1cfc769a.jpg) that is only as long as the start of her hips. It's a worn, slightly darker than tan with plenty of cracks and age marks. It's completely broken in and very comfortable. Below that Sona has a [black short sleeve shirt](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/da/8b/47/da8b47e404f550e068de5bca0323399c.jpg) with openings in the shoulder and over the chest. She prefers the shirt as it keeps her a little cooler in the Vacuan heat. She wears it with [denim shorts](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/198932508526422502/) and a pair of [brown boots](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0d/e3/6a/0de36a54706872deae9536930fd95c47.jpg) with the tops folded over, revealing the flannel patterned interior. Her socks are black and knee high, with a white ring around the top. Sona wears a black choker in this outfit. 

In her Vacuan outfit, Sona wears a [leather holster](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e2/36/5c/e2365c0cee7b5f7410cff0d1072f6fa0.jpg) belt. Mounted on the back are the sheathes for Talio and Venia, in their knife form. The holster the same color as her jacket. There are pouches mounted on the lower straps on both legs. She has loops for dust cartridges on either side of the belt piece. 


## Valean Outfit

Sona wears a [white and blue corset](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/02/15/93/0215935f159d6b96bf5ef80bc4f496ad.jpg) top which has a fairly low cut. There is a neck piece to the corset which she is fond of, buckling around her neck. It is thin enough it doesn't impede her neck movements (it's not as wide as the sample). Below the corset she has a [black shirt](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/cc/41/6c/cc416c50b855d778a75778e3238cf8b0.jpg) with long sleeves and cut outs on the upper arm. The shirt is tucked into a [blue skirt](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ae/78/6a/ae786ad98663f1e7347c059ce61df3c6.jpg) of the same color as the corset that rests just above the hem. The skirt is high waisted, but most of the waist sits under the corset. The skirt is of a velvet linen, weighted material that retains heat well. She wears black tights that aren't 100% opaque. She has [knee high boots with a wool cuff](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/77/ce/c4/77cec4de54f1e0307a78bb1ebd1b3bce.jpg), the wool piece white while the boots themselves are a light brown. Finally, she wears the same leather jacket from her Vacuan outfit. 

In her Valean outfit, Sona has holsters for Talio and Venia's knife form on the belt of the corset. They rest cross on the small of her back. She has a pouch on that belt as well for other items, on her non dominant hand. She has loops for dust cartridges on the other side. 

# History

 

# Personality



# Combat Ability

Sona is a quick and aggressive fighter. She gets up close and personal with opponents, not giving them space to make use of larger weapons or even react to her. Her weapons, Talio and Venia, small size compliment this style. Sona has more practice with the chakram form of her weapons and prefers them in practice. She is capable of catching opponents weapons in the ring to wrap them up, even using the leverage to yank the weapon from their hands. She uses the knife form when there's space requirements, and when she tries to make her weapons harder to follow. The lower profile single blade is harder for the opponent to track as she moves and she's practiced switching the grip on her blade mid swing. Sona tends to forget to use dust. She uses the throwing ability of the chakram only when closing distances or when unable to reach the target. 

Sona is a lightning bruiser. Her speed lets her dodge the majority of attacks made at her. She is well accustomed to being hurt and ignores pain well, allowing her to brush of hits and keep swinging. She doesn't think ahead in combat, instead relying on instinct in a fight. This gets her hit more than she needs to and she can get exhausted quickly, but she's able to do a lot of damage quickly. 

## Aura & Semblance

Sona's aura has developed in a unique way. Due to her past, she adapted to disable her aura before it properly shattered. Sona's aura shatters after a significant amount of damage, though it is not truly gone. After a serious hit in this pseudo shattered state her aura surges back to life. Effectively, every 3 or 4 hits on her aura causes it to drop, and when she takes a hit the aura returns. Her aura is truly shattered after 9 iterations of this behavior, which is why she called it her Nine Lives. Sona has no control over this behaviors, it's an ingrained habit she does subconsciously. 



# Talio and Venia

*Retribution and Forgiveness* 

Talio and Venia are a pair of weapons, both effectively identical. Their first form is that of a knife, the blade being a little over a foot in length. The hilt is oddly long as well. There is a slight protrusion from the blade over the top of the hilt, keep the hand from sliding up over the blade.

The second form is that of a chakram, a bladed disk. the blade of the knife form rotates around and back, the tip of the knife sliding into the base of the hilt to form a circle. The blade of the knife form is telescoping, so despite the extension there is a bladed edge all the way from hilt end to end. Chakram are balanced for throwing like a boomerang and Sona's are no exception. Sona is well practiced with throwing them and knows how to catch the ring at the hilt consistently.  The circle is around a foot in diameter.

### Dust

Talio and Venia can use two forms of dust cartridge. Both use the same cartridge type, an approximately 6 inch canister that contains powdered dust. It is inserted into the hilt of either weapon, the chamber accessed by rotating the hilt. The first is filled with a single color of dust, while the second is filled with layered packets. The layered variant holds less dust due the dividers, but allows Sona to use multiple dust types without changing cartridge. 

Dust can be used in either form of the weapons. Both are able to pipe dust through the blade. When doing so with electric or fire dust it either electrifies or super heats the blade. The Chakram form can use wind dust when thrown to increase the spin speed and distance of the throw.
