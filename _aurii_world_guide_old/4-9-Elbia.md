*Ebb-lee-a: The buried remnant.*

Eblia was a country in the far east of the continent. Nestled against the mountains with waterfall to provide their water from the great lakes in the high peaks, the country florished. Many buildings were partially carved into mountains and cliffs and Eblia was known as a mason's city. The country traded mined materials through Theanovene, having a monopoly on the market. Their primary import wad foodstuffs, with the mountains to their back and desert to the south they had very little area to grow on. Eventually in a bid to gain a little production for themselves Eblia started settling away from their mountain range, forming small fishing villages across the plains. 

Just as their efforts in the fishing villages came to fruitation, disaster struck. An earthquake shook the eastern mountains, the tremor spreading up the mountains and cracking them violently. Large pieces of the mountains slid down the still stable ones, destroying everything built into the mountain and crushing what wasn't. Eblia, in the span of a few hours, was completely destroyed. Those few not at home during the event had to bring the news to the men and women at the fledging fishing village; many couldn't take the loss and took to the waters, joining their families in the afterlife. 

Those who remained of Eblia had nothing. The fishing villages were barely up and running a few years, not stocked to rebuild a kingdom. The rivers that flowed from the mountain lakes dried up, dammed by the fallen mountain. The only surviving piece of the nation was abandoned, no longer fit for living. This was almost a century ago. 

The remaining Eblians were welcomed to other nations, many moving to Theanovene and trying to live on. What little of their culture remains is preserved quietly in the home, though a grand statue to their nation resides in a Theanovene park. Their land has been left unsettled; not out of respect for the dead but due to it's seperation from current world powers and less than ideal resources. The mountains containing the ruins of the Eblia lie quietly, dangerous to anyone who tries to explore them. People do attempt to delve into the ruins every summer, trying to find the one piece of Elbian history that could make them rich.

**O - Baygrove**: The last remnant of the kingdom to have inhabitants. That said, this village is merely a agreed upon base camp by explorers, archeaologists, and treasure hunters heading into Elbia.
