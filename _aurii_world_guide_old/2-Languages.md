* **Veen** *V-een*: Originally starting as a trading language, Veen was formalized and backed by Theanovene as a way to communicate with every region when Theanovene secured it's role as the central trade hub in Aurii. 

* **Erain** *Eh-rain*: The language of tradition and the clergy. It's a flowing language and sounds beautiful when spoken. Songs sung in Erain are much beloved in other nations. The language is still in use in Eraia, most writing in the realm (asides from things meant for visitors and travellers) is Erain. The clergy has a variant written form of Eraia called "High Erain". It is heretical to read High Erain outside of a church and only the clergy may read it. 

* **Drel** *Dre-ll**: The language of the Drecan people before they made contact with the mainland years ago. It's a easy to speak language, every word seems shorter than it's equivilant in another language. It can make Drel sound clipped and rushed when natives speak it. Drel is still very much in use in Dreca.

* **Wynnish**: A dead language used by the Wynne people long before they started their relationship with Callorian Kingdoms. Long words define the language and speaking Wynnish is an art form. The words are unique and seem to carry a power to them. The language fell out of use and things that didn't exist back in the time it was used have no words in Wynnish. Wynnites use the occasional word from Wynnish day to day, but as accents rather than a way of communicating.
