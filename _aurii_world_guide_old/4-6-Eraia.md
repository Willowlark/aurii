*E-rai-ah : The Nation blessed by the Goddess*

## Ruling Class

**Type of Rule**: Theocractic Empire

Eraia is theocractical first and an empire second. Formed originally from a small church on the coast, Eraia built itself up over time. After the city expanded to it's full size, Eraia decided to bring the glory of it's Goddess to the other Nations. Eraia began a crusade, spreading into the Laguz territory and up to the fledging Callora. It's expansion slowed due to conflict, and the empire has been holding ever since.

Eraia is guided by the church and the church wants to expand it's influence around the country. The pope leads the church, elected from the cardinals and bishops in power. People rise through the ranks through not so equal parts faith and impressing those above them in the church. The military is directed by bishops from the Great Cathedral.

## Culture & Social Classes

Eraia is a theoractic empire, a nation shaped by it's religion. From a young age citizens are introduced to the church and it's teachings and any other belief is heretical. The church has multiple sacraments it brings young children in through to educate them fully on the beliefs of the church. Children are not members of society until 16, most of their time being dedicated to the study of religion. There are frequent celebrations and events in the name of the Church, often celebrating the most recent achievement of the children.

Eraia has many farms in it's territory. A good portion of Eraia's diet is grown, with supplement of fish. Red meat is less common tables than chicken or fish. Hunting is not a popular profession in Eraia. Some forms of meat aren't eaten in Eraia, including deer, pigs, salmon, and duck. To eat one is heretical. 

Almost everything in Eraia comes with a phrase or exchange to be shared from scripture. Buying something in the store, meeting a friend on the road, seeing a Bishop, entering a home, there's a tradition to be followed all the time. It can be jarring for visitors to the country. 

Eraia has strict standards on cleanliness. There are inns at entrances to every town and city where dusty travellers are expected to clean themselves. When doing a job where one must get dirty, workers are expected to clean themselves before they leave the site. 

Eraia has it's own language, *Erain*. Eraian is spoken infrequently in towns as the common tongue has taken precidence. Every citizen of Eraia is raised with at least a working understanding of it. That's important as all church business, both public and private, is conducted in Erain. 

Family life is important to Eraia. It is expected to be married by 25, and if you aren't the church will help you get hitched. Divorce isn't allowed in the kingdom as well, it's a crime against the sanctity of God's marriage. It's uncommon to see the woman in the marriage providing for the family. It's not unheard of, particularly for soldiers with excellent records who the church would rather not see leave the battlefield, but it is strange. There's no stigma to a woman continuing her career past starting a family in the military. So as long as one parent stays, the other has no issues. But since the woman is the one to carry the child, that break tends to roll into dropping the military career.

Laguz are welcomed in Lylalel's light. The church does segregate Laguz, not allowing them to attend masses yet expecting them to hold to the scriptures as an example. However the people of Eraia are kind enough to Laguz who are willing to follow the tenants of Lylalel. They aren't equals, but they are no less deserving of Lylalel's light.

## Religion: Lylalel

Lylalel is portrayed as a woman in white, beautiful with golden hair and eyes as deep blue as sapphire. Her image adorns more buildings in the capital than not. Her worshippers wear white to be as pure as her image. It is believed she created the world, and that each man woman and child of Eraia are her children. She is the guardian of all who give her tribute. Her church is the only right in the world, any that would deny her words are servants of Lyarlel, her opposite. Where Lylalel is there is light, and all shadow in the world comes from her corrupt brother, Lyarlel. Lylalel is too kind, too pure to strike her brother down so she may spread her light to the world at large. Her children, the men and women of Eraia, take up this task for her. 

The religion of Lylalel has written scripture which has been the scripture as long as anyone can remember. Only the clergy may see the scripture, to read it for masses. Other items of note in the church are the Light of Lyalalel, a snow white candle that is kept lit in every believers home and place of worship. As long as the light burns, Lyarlel's evil will never touch the residents of the place. The church, in honor of deeds done in the nanme Lylalel, will bestow stain glass shards upon a family. These crests are placed in special mounts that shine the image on the nearby wall. These shards of Lylalel are a great honor to the family. 

<!-- Some church tradition is only in the church, not the scripture. Lyarlel is an evil dragon. -->

Swearing an oath to God is a serious claim in Eraia. Those who do not complete that claim in Eraia are brought before the church decides on the weight of their transgression and what must be done to rectify it. It is possible that the claim is against another tenant of God. The person in question is then stuck between a rock and a hard place, no matter what they do the church will come for them. 

When a clothed member of the clergy passes a citizen of Eraia, the citzen is expected to bow their head and step aside. Foreigners are at the least expected to step aside as well, which has caused trouble before. Most citizens will pull a foreigner aside as to not spark a conflict. 

It's a common wish for a faithful servant of Lylalel to give their last prayer to her before leaving the mortal plane to be by her side. It's something often lost to soldiers, a sacrifice made while accepting the crusade of spreading her light to the world. They die alone on a battle field, and while Lylalel is surely to bless them for their service missing the chance to give that last prayer is a dying regret. Traditionally these last prayers are in Lylalel's church, her home and soon to be the home the one praying. 

It is heretical to speak of another God in Eraia. No crime, murder included, is ranked worse than slandering or promoting another God. If you aren't attacked on the spot, you'll be arrested and tried in the church. 

## Military

Eraia has the largest military on the continent. As part of the church, soldiers are on a holy crusade to spread the religion of Eraia around the globe. This and frequent motivating speeches from the church leaders makes them dedicated and enthusastic about every engagement. Eraia has a fleet of ships and extensive infantry, their heavy armor troops are the best on the continent. Eraia's calvary is it's only lacking point; what horses they have are dedicated to mounted generals and paladins (armored mounted unit, a force to be reckoned with on the field.) 

Occasionally enthusiasm is taken for skill in Eraia. While Eraia has plenty of ace units whose careers are highly decorated, there are just as many soldiers out to do their part in the name of the Goddess with no concept of what fighting on the battlefield means. Because of this an army fighting Eraia's may occasionally defeat one man and rout a regiment. At the same time, single men in Eraia's military can take out an entire regiment on their own. It's best to never underestimate the Eraia crusaders.

Lyall's Lighthouse is actually a military building. Loranrowe lighthouse was built as Eraia built up it's navy to spread the word of Lylalel to the other continents. While it's primary purpose was as a lighthouse, it has held many military conferences and entire floors of the tower are dedicated to supplies for the crusades. In modern times, some of the lower floors have been dedicated to a museum of the Kouneli island's conquest in the name of Lylalel.

The top of the lighthouse is not open air. It's very hard to tell from the distance a ship usually sees Loranrowe from but the light is surrounded by stained glass, depicting Lylalel's soldiers sailing out in her name. On rare nights the setting sun illuminates the panes and projects them onto a part in central Lyall. It's a beautiful sight. 

## Trade & Economy

Eraia exports worked metal, glass, and other practical items as well as minerals mined in the desert. The primary imports of Eraia are wax, furs, and foreign meats. It's trade routes aren't short, travelling south from Theanovene, across the southern pennisula, and then across the water to the capital. It would be faster for Eraia to work with Callora, but the tension between the country makes structured trade between them impossible. 

## Foreign Relations

* **Wynne**: Eraia considers Wynne to be heretical two fold, for both their ancestoral beliefs and primary diet of deer. Putting aside any differences with Callora, Eraia could never be allied with Wynne even indirectly. Wynne is currently out of sight out of mind, but that could change in time. 

* **Callora**: As the nearest neighbor of Eraia, Callora was the first nation Eraia tried to spread their religion to. While that conflicct ended in a stalemate, the tension between the nations has never relaxed. While not actively at war, every citizen of Eraia knows Callora would be the first nation in the second crusade of Eraia.

* **Torshan**: 

* **Dwyr**:

* **Rocnas**:

* **Theanovene**: Theanovene, as a city, is far too much of melting pot to meet Eraia's standards. However any ambassador of Theanovene that interacts with Eraia respects all of Eraia's many traditions and scriptures. Because of their respect for Lylalel, Theanovene is passed over by the church's judgements. It also helps that Theanovene is the only nation trading with Eraia. 

* **Dreca**: Eraia is being attacked by Dreca. To Eraia, both in propoganda and reality, Dreca is a corrupted country controlled by Lyarlel. It's militaristic nature and cruel treatment of the laguz after the invasion on the main land are all actions in line with the teachings of Lyarlel. Given this, the war with Dreca is not just self defense, it's a holy crusade.

## Settlements & Places of Interest

* **I - Estad**: A small Eraian town. There's a fair bit of military presence in Town, Estad was a staging point back during the war with Callora. While no where near as much as there used to be, Estad gets by as the border town between the two countries, keeping the military installments functional just in case.
* **J - Trisp**: is a town separated out from the rest of Eraia as a form of monestary. The village consists mainly of a large church complex where light magic, Lylalel, and all things in her light are studied. The rest of the village are farmers are other tradesmen who keep the complex running smoothly. It's a quiet place that rarely gets visitors. 
* **K - Lyall**: The grand capital of Eraia. Black and purple decorations adorn stain glass coated walls. Churches stand out as darker stone than the rest of the buildings. The grand cathedral is one of the largest buildngs in the world, with half a dozen wings covering every aspect of Eraian's religion and government. 
* **L - Lithis**: Orignally the capital of the rabbit laguz. Originally a city covered in grass, it was a strange yet wonderful feeling of being on a grassy knoll and yet in the city. That said after Eraia took over there are much more stone streets and buildings, the trademark black churches of Eraia in stark contrast to the prior buildngs. 
* **M - Ebonary**: A fledging trade city for Eraia. Built like a smaller Lyall, the city was founded to faciitate trade between Theanovene and Eraia. The city is characterized by large wooden drydocks where Eraia is building ships. It's recently had an influx of Kissaelain residents, refugees from the conquered territories. The war is starting to affect the city, the miitary presence has increased drastically and the drydocks are starting to look towards naval ship designs.
* **T - Effera**: is a small town that's mostly military. The town came up as a outpost at first to protect Eraia's trade route with Theanovene. It's inception was a wise move, Dreca quickly moving their area of influence. The outpost built up quickly into a town and also serves as a protection point for traders along the Drecian border.
