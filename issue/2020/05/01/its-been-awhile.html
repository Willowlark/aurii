        <div  markdown="1">
        
            <p>I haven’t cracked this open since my first week on the mainland. I should be writing detailed documentation about troop movements, or what I’ve discovered of Eraian prayer habits. I… can’t bring myself to. Things have changed, in the last few months, and I need to get my thoughts in line. SO here we are. No one would mess with a superior officer’s private notes, would they?</p>

<p><em>“… Hope not.”</em></p>

<p>The rank and file seem generally intimidated by me, or at the least Sasha. My Wing still respect me too, somehow. But they clearly don’t like some of the calls I’ve been making on deployments, and neither do the pencil pushers moving units around. That’s… what’s changed. Apparently Dryn’s ideals of expand Dreca to the mainland also include razing all those that live on the mainland before we do. We have territory yet we continue a razing campaign that’s savage, more savage than anything the Academy could prepare you for.</p>

<p>People are enjoying it too! Sure Dryn has told us all about how the mainlanders banished us, and we preserved on the island they thought would kill us off. I can see being upset by that, being our history. Mainlanders even cut ties with us after we did that, making sure we couldn’t get supplies from off island. There’s… Yeah okay, lots of reasons to hate the mainlanders.</p>

<p>But! Burning innocent, non combatant villages? Attacking people who’ve surrendered? The… top brass are ordering this war fought dirty and I don’t know how I feel about that. Well. I guess I do.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be so desperate to vent a damn field guide if I was on board with this. I’ve been ordering my Wing, and any ground troops I get the chance to give orders to, to stand down yet. I’m one man, and Dreca is running mission after mission, and I’m not even COUNTING the ones on the front line against actual soldiers. My Wing and the brass are somehow pissed too? All mission objectives have been met, yet they’re upset there are surviving civilians? That farms aren’t razed completely?</p>

<p>Whatever thirst has come over the troops now that we’re deployed just isn’t right. Maybe they don’t think about it, or mainlanders aren’t even people to them. But I can’t stop seeing one tiger… laggo? Tiger woman huddling with her kid. It’s war, and I’m all for getting the land we NEED to survive… but do I have to do with the brutality of my fellows? Can I not completely the objectives efficiently, without feeding humans to Sasha?</p>

<p>… I guess this is the way it though. In war. There’s a reason it’s not a good thing. Follow orders, do the damage… win. Take back what was ours, better the lives of the Drecian people.</p>

<p><em>“… I just wish Dryn’s words inspired me the way they used to.”</em></p>
