<p>With Afina retreating in their eyes, the sabatours return their attention to the masts of the Astor. The wind greatly interferes with launching the fireballs at them at first, but like a long range archer they slowly compensate for the wind after each shot and bring their fireballs closer to the cloth masts.</p>

<p>(ooc: Keep on keeping on. The masts now have hit points, as if they were an ally character. They follow the same rules as any other ally; they take one damage a turn (until the sabatours are defeated particularly, in this case). They will not earn dice (they‚Äôre masts, for christ‚Äôs sake) but if you take actions to defend them, you can roll defense dice ‚Äòfor‚Äô the masts.)</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-03-22</em></p>

<p>Faun dove into a double-cross low at the two pirates just getting off the plank. Both took solid hits to the legs, knocking them on their chests in pain. Elfriede, feeling determined once more, got his second wind. He sprinted halfway across the plank and met several laguz head on. The first in the group stabbed in at him. Faun brought his dagger up, locked its hilt with the sword and with a twist pointed the stab outward to the left. His rapiers tip came down fast into the shin of the unfortunate pirate. He Jerked his left hand outward pulling the pirate overboard in one fluid motion.</p>

<p>As the pirate fell he grabbed at Faun getting a slight hold on his ankle before falling. Even though it was only a brief grappling, it knocked him off balance as the next pirate came down hard with a mace. Faun started to dodge right by tilting his body, but the mace still came down hard on his left shoulder. The glancing blow made his arm go numb. A moment later there was a splash in the water caused by the knight Lieutenant‚Äôs lost dagger. Elfriede winced at his arm and even teared up a bit at the shooting pain. The mace came across again as the pirate was looking to end it, but was met with the steel of Elfriede‚Äôs tough rapier.</p>

<p>Faun ducked and pushed the mace up high, following it up with a stab through the chest. In one fluid motion he yanked his sword free and side-kicked the pirate backwards into the two behind them. One of them lost footing and fell off right then, while the other fell on their back. He ran over top of the two prone bodies taking special care to stomp <strong>hard</strong> on the downed <em>and still alive</em> pirates chest. He jumped off the plank and landed on the deck of the pirates stolen ship. His arm throbbed in pain, feeling had not started to return to the limb yet, for it hung loosely at his left.</p>

<p>The two remaining mages where already eyeing him as the most immediate threat and began throwing fireballs his way. Elfriede dodged left and right while running for the stairs to get to the mages floor. Another sword wielding pirate rounded the corner and engaged him. Elfriede ducked and side stepped thier two swings respectively and countered with one of his own‚Ä¶ which landed once again through the chest. Wasting no time he ran up the wooden stairs only to be blocked at the top by a curtain of fire. Elfriede clicked his tongue and ran back down and desperately began glancing around. <strong>This needed to end.</strong></p>

<p>He looked back to the Aster thought of all the innocent folk being killed with each passing second and his blood boiled. At least Afina was still alive, he thought to himself as he constantly had the reassurance of beams and balls of light going off all around the battlefield. ‚ÄúWhere is the one calling the shots of this disgrace of a ship.‚Äù He growled through gritted teeth. He saw a door that clearly went into a room on the ship, which he went over to. <em>Better than nothing‚Ä¶</em> He thought as he opened the door and entered.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-03-23</em></p>

<p>Once she had acquired a tactically-favorable position away from the fighting, Afina took a deep breath, clearing her mind of the gore and violence that seemed to be occuring around her. <em>If I could just take out the mages, this fight could be over</em>, she thought, glancing between her spellbook and the enemy mages. Some of them still stood, having deemed that their fallen comrade was still alive. They knew her best trick by now; Afina would have to be creative to catch them off guard. The swinging sails of the enemy ship caught the Laeran‚Äôs eye. <em>Perfect</em>.</p>

<p>The princess withdrew a piece of paper hidden among the folds of her dress, crouching behind a stack of crates to provide her own cover. As she began to read, a small fireball formed in her hand, no larger than a marble. The small fireball shot forward, severing the bonds of a single rope that held the sail in place, causing the bright white sails to dip down ever so slightly. <em>Why bother trying to destroy the sails when one could just down them instead?</em> Afina thought, the steadfast ropes snapping one by one. The mages themselves were too occupied with targeting the Aster‚Äôs mast and sails to notice that their own was being dismantled piece by piece.</p>

<p>As the last rope snapped, Afina‚Äôs page smoldered into nothingness, and she released it as she quickly switched to her light spellbook. An incandescent ball of light blinded the mages, as the sail came crashing down upon their heads. The Kouneli scrambled underneath the sheet, only one managing to escape from underneath the fallen sail. The quintessential halo formed on the ground beneath the mages‚Äô feet, and in a moment, the rabbit laguz were enveloped in a purifying beam of light. Their bodies collapsed beneath the sails, unconscious.</p>

<p>Afina watched as the lone mage scrambled away, conjuring a wall of fire to keep out‚Ä¶ Elfriede? Afina squinted, leaning over the rail of the ship. <em>Why was Elfriede on the enemy ship?</em> The knight was doing well enough; he defeated every enemy pirate that challenged him. Afina hurried down the stairs of the Aster. She would have to board the enemy ship as well to defeat the last mage, who hid behind walls of fire. <em>Dumb coward</em>, she thought, approaching the gangplank. The princess hesitated, glancing back at the fighting that seemed to be winding down on the Aster. <em>They‚Äôll survive, eliminating the mage is my duty</em>, she thought, crossing to the enemy ship.</p>

<p>As Elfriede disappeared through a door in the ship, Afina turned to the enemy fire mage. The Kouneli woman snickered, and Afina spotted that the fire mage lacked a front tooth. <em>Gross</em>. ‚ÄúHaving second thoughts now that your knight is gone, Eraian girl?‚Äù the pirate asked, the fire walls that had burned brightly only moments before having petered out.</p>

<p>Afina straightened her back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Laeran, if that stands to make a difference to the likes of you,‚Äù the princess stated, as if the fact was painfully obvious.</p>

<p>The pirate woman‚Äôs cocky smirk dropped, thoroughly unamused with Afina. ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù she said, hands lingering towards her tattered stack of papers. <em>Was THAT her spell book</em>, Afina thought. Whoever these pirates were, they weren‚Äôt very bountiful if they couldn‚Äôt afford a simple spellbook.</p>

<p>In her moment of distraction, Afina just narrowly dodged a fireball sent spiraling towards her. The inferno grazed the princess‚Äô right arm, and Afina could feel the scorching burn. The kouneli woman laughed, shooting another fireball soon after. This time, however, Afina reacted quickly with a light ball of her own. The two magics collided in midair, and the light faded out as the fireball fizzled into the ground.</p>

<p>There, the two women stood, sizing each other up for combat. Afina gripped her wounded arm, her spell book wedged up against her chest. She was determined not to lose this fight.</p>
