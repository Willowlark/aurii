<p>The Captain watches Elfriede being run through with a stoic expression. He turns around as the knight-lieutenant hits the deck and begins ordering the returned pirates about the ship. They release their main mast and the ship starts to separate from the Aster, the gangplanks will fall into the drink in no more than a minute‚Äôs time. Cheers echo from the Aster, celebrating their victory. A few crewman manage to notice their downed guests on the other end of the gangplanks, though none are brave enough to risking running across the gangplank to them. There‚Äôs time for one trip across, not a trip there and back.</p>

<p>(ooc: Technically Elfriede has lost and I get to narrate a suitable defeat for him. He did that to himself though, so I‚Äômma skip it. Afina‚Äôs extra escape successes bled over into Elfriede‚Äôs, both are able to escape in this round. By escaping you‚Äôve cleared the conflict as well, so narrate your success.)</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-03-29</em></p>

<p>In an instant, the pirate ship was engulfed in a brilliant white light. Like a shockwave, it burst outwards, with Afina and Elfriede at its center. The air whipped around the mage and the knight from the sudden detonation, and Afina held on tighter to Elfriede as she gawked at the spell that surrounded them. They stood at the peaceful eye of the storm, with hollering pirates on every side.</p>

<p>Afina stood up straighter as the light faded and she was left standing amongst the fallen pirates with Elfriede. Some had collapsed, while others lay in fetal position, and still more were doubled over in pain. A bright light glinted in the corner of her eye, and Afina swiftly bent over to grab Elfriede‚Äôs rapier. ‚ÄúAlright, now we must go,‚Äù she said, to direct Elfriede as well as herself. He seemed to manage a nod in response, and she tried not to notice how pale he was getting.</p>

<p>They started for the gangplank, which seemed dangerously close to separating from the two boats entirely. Afina pushed Elfriede in front of her, before turning to face the enemy ship once more so that she could ensure no one pursued them. ‚ÄúSeize her!‚Äù the captain hollered from his position on one knee.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo not!‚Äù Afina yelled, pointing Elfriede‚Äôs rapier at the enemy pirates. The remaining laguz hesitated, and Afina carefully began to backup along the gangplank. Halfway across with no indication of pursuers, Afina lowered the weapon, and returned to ushering Elfriede across. Shoving her book underneath her arm, Afina helped to support Elfriede as best she could, even as the adrenaline subsided from her body and fatigue began to set in.</p>

<p>Their boots hit the deck with a <em>thunk</em> just as the gangplank began to slide off its ledge. Afina‚Äôs own knees were weak, but she put on a brave face as she turned to the crew. ‚ÄúCan I get some assistance?‚Äù she asked, cocking an eyebrow. The crew jumped to assist the fallen knight, and Afina followed close at their heels as they half-carried, half-dragged Elfriede to his bunk.</p>

<p>Afina‚Äôs mind was running through the options. She didn‚Äôt know healing magic, so any assistance was beyond her capability. <em>Well, perhaps except for sewing</em>, she thought to herself, desperately hoping that the situation did not degrade <em>that</em> poorly. ‚ÄúIs there a healing mage on this ship?‚Äù Afina asked one of the crewmen. He nodded slowly, unsurely. Afina scowled. ‚ÄúOkay, then let me do your job, go get the mage!‚Äù Afina said, shoving aside the sailor to return to assisting Elfriede.</p>

<p>The princess struggled for words. Her first inkling was to ask if Elfriede was alright, which clearly he was not. Perhaps there was something inspiring to be said. He <em>had</em> fought well after all, if it a bit too boldly. Afina remembered how he looked when they had locked eyes on the ship. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be alright,‚Äù she said quietly, leaning over to address him directly.</p>

<p>One of the sailors opened the door to Elfriede‚Äôs bunk and laid the knight down. Afina stepped aside as the medical mage entered, and immediately turned his attention to Elfriede. <em>He was stable now</em>, she thought, collapsing into the desk chair near the bed. Her forearm throbbed with pain where the fireball had glanced off of it, and scorch marks and ash peppered her dress, while dark soot stained her bright hair. Blood was caked on the underside of her boots, and the seams she had repaired in her dress from the last fight had begun to tear. Blood spattered her cloak where she had assisted Elfriede, and the princess gingerly removed the garment, folding her arms across her chest.</p>

<p>The clank of metal hitting the floor snapped Afina back to attention. They had removed Elfriede‚Äôs armor, and were undoing his jacket. The medical mage produced a pair of scissors, and they began to cut away at his undershirt. Alarmed, Afina wondered if she should exit the room. Luckily, however, that was the full level of undressing they did on Elfriede, and Afina breathed a sigh of relief. She leaned back in her chair, legs and arms crossed. <em>Finally, everything was taken care of</em>, she thought, eyes closing. If she herself could just relax a couple minutes‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-03-29</em></p>

<p>The world around him began to revolve. Afina suddenly embraced and supported him. He clutched his wound hopelessly as they were slowly surrounded by the remaining pirates. Faun‚Äôs legs felt weak under him. The situation seems so incredibly hopeless. He was to die here‚Ä¶ failing in his duty and Afina would be captured. Despite everything he did during this fight to save them and the Aster‚Ä¶ it seemed to not matter.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright light swirled about them everywhere he looked. He had never seen anything like it. A small flicker of hope kept him standing against a blackout of consciousness. Intense nausea fell over him with every‚Ä¶ <em>step?</em>. <em>They were walking across to the Aster? When had that happened?</em> He didn‚Äôt fully grasp everything around him, but he knew he owed the princess a great debt. With his head angled downward, he saw blood pour out of his stomach with every step. He had no idea how he was still standing. <em>Is someone supporting me?</em></p>

<p>Once he touch down on the ship, the next few moments he was barely conscious. He remembered be carried, then being in a bed. Afina shouting about a mage and‚Ä¶ then‚Ä¶ <em>Afina staring up at him smilingly lightly.</em> ‚Äú<em>You‚Äôll be alright.</em>‚Äù Even in his barely conscious stupor Elfriede felt the weight behind her words. Her tired eyes open wide with an intense concerned stare. Her smile was forced. He wanted to thank her but he couldn‚Äôt find the strength to even speak.</p>

<p>She was completely covered in blood on one side of her body, which Faun was able to discern was his own. <em>Look at how repulsive I am, bleeding all over the women I was supposed to be protecting.</em> Thinking about how pathetic he was in this moment he wanted to cry, but again the world swirled black and he drifted into unconsciousness. He faintly heard shuffling through the blackness as people worked on his wound. In the next hour, in what felt like a deep sleep, he dreamed of himself drowning. But in the moment just before he was going to run out of breath, a hand plunged into in the water and dragged him above it. He felt embarrassed, but at peace. <em>‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù</em></p>
