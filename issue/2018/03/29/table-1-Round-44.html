            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-03-29</em></p>

<p>“Gentlemen” the man in white says, raising his arms to the assembled people in the cave. Said ‘gentlemen’ chuckle and laugh at being called such. “You were promised a raid; I gave you a raid. You were promised pillaging; I provided you an entire town to pillage. You asked for chaos; and I supplied such. Then you asked for a sacrifice.” The man orates. He then kicks Nokri in the stomach.</p>

<p>“I bring you a sacrifice. This heathen is from Dreca, the southern nation of sinners and criminals. Whatever sins you must commit to satisfy your lust for violence, doing so to this slime with be a <em>service to the light.</em>” The room laughs at the term, but Nokri can see the rather psychotic grins spread across the ‘gentlemen’s’ faces. One comes up to the balcony level, and the man in white nods to him. The newcomer tossed Nokri over a shoulder and shouts to the room.</p>

<p>“At midnight, we sacrifice the <em>heathen</em>, and spill the <em>heathen’s</em> blood across the floor!” And the room explodes into cheers. The man in white rolls his eyes and turns on his heel down the stairs.</p>

<hr />

<p>Desii smiles. “I appreciate the help. I couldn’t refuse after hearing Dain’s story.” Almost as if on cue, the bartender in question re enters. Desii directs her smile to him, and it spreads to the man.</p>

<p>“How about a round on the house?” He says. He grabs four mugs from his cupboard and suddenly the door swings open. A middle aged woman with long brown hair charges into the room, collapsing to her knees in the center of the inn. She’s wheezing and panting in the worst way, both sounding and looking like she ran a marathon.</p>

<p>“Dain…!” she pants out. “Another…! Enera…! A…Again!” she starts coughing. The bartender has already vaulted the bar and ran to her.</p>

<p>“Saila, take a breather! We’ll fix it, whatever it is, so just breath!” he says worriedly, rubbing the woman’s back. It’s a minute before she does catch her breath and as soon as she does she continues.</p>

<p>“I saw a young girl get taken, taken by <em>a man in a white cloak</em>! Eraia’s doing it again Dain, they’re taking another daughter from her home!” Dain immediately pulls Saila in close, holding her tight as if she could fade away if he didn’t.</p>

<p>“Did you see who?” Dain says, still holding his wife.</p>

<p>“No, just that she had straw blonde hair in twin braids…” Saila says as she slowly pushes herself out of Dain’s embrace. “The man rode off to the east, towards the mountain range, we have to do… do something!”</p>

<p>“Absolutely Saila.” Dain says with a powerful nod. “Lets start by checking the families in town. There were only a few girls with blonde hair in town, once we find whose missing we can coordinate with the parents to rescue her.” Saila nods back, and they run out of their inn, completely forgetting your group exists.</p>

<p>Desii is already standing and had been listening intently to the conversation.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I have to help them with this as well.” she says to the two men before her. “They’ve been so good to me, and to let the same thing that happened to Enera happen to another girl? It’d kill Dain and Saila.” Despite her conviction, she seems confused as to what to do as she looks left and right, showing nervous ticks left and right.</p>

<p>“Until they find out who it is… I suppose I could gather the town guard in advance, that would save time…” she mumbles as she puts her things into her sling bag.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nokri is carried over the man’s shoulder like a pig to the slaughter through the dining hall. The assembled ‘gentlemen’ all lean in as she’s carried through the center aisle of tables, laughing and pointing. There’s applause as your captor heads down a side passage and you can no longer see the main hall.</p>

<p>The side passage quickly leads to a jail cell set into an alcove of the cave system, which the man tosses you into unceremoniously. He locks the door with a massive key, which is puts on his person.</p>

<p>“Sorry it don’t got a plush bed. But we’ll be… <em>upgrading</em> your accommodations within 24 hours.” he sneers. He then leaves and you can hear applause echoing through the cave system again.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-04-02</em></p>

<p>“We shall,” Eliran says as he exits the inn and runs to catch up with Dain, “hey dain,” he calls out, hoping to get the man’s attention, “we’d like to help out!”</p>
