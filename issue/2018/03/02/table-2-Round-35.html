            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-03-02</em></p>

<p>Despite the area‚Äôs many twists and turns you don‚Äôt find it difficult to navigate to the ship docked here. It‚Äôs masts stand tall and proud, no matter how many crates stand between you and the ship you can see the crow‚Äôs nest of the ship. As you turn around yet another corner made by yet another row of crates you see the ship come into view. It‚Äôs a beautiful ship, larger than you could have guessed. The wood, despite the late hour, seems to have highlights of light in it streaking across it‚Äôs frame. After a moment you realize this is merely a combination of light and dark wood, but your confusion at all validates the creator‚Äôs work. The ship isn‚Äôt just pretty either, you can see cannon ports on it‚Äôs sides and the wheel from even where you stand. While it‚Äôs in the process of being loaded with cargo you can tell the ship can hold it‚Äôs own in naval combat.</p>

<p>As your eyes drift from the ship to the loading area you quickly can spot a group of people scurrying about. You wonder if the wine at dinner was too strong for a moment before you realize it is not an illusion, the figures have long ears flopping around from the tops of their head. It‚Äôs rare to see Kouneli, or rabbit laguz, off of their island to the west.</p>

<p>The Kouneli move quickly and efficiently, loading select crates into the hold of the ship while others scurry about on deck. They seem too preoccupied to notice you though.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-03-04</em></p>

<p>The light extinguishes as Afina‚Äôs eyebrows furrow. ‚ÄúRabbit laguz?‚Äù she asks, ‚ÄúThis far east? Is Eraia that busy of a trading port?‚Äù <em>Surely they must have some interesting business to be all the way in Ebonary</em>, she thinks. <em>And for the ship to be so well defended, the crates sealed tight‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p>Afina did not trust the nature of the situation; why would any battle-ready ship load sealed cargo in the dark? Especially in Eraia, where light was considered as much a staple as food and shelter. Her better nature wanted to intervene, at least to ask what the crew was doing. But doing so would put her at risk; Like she had thought in the Effera square, a Calloran princess had no right meddling in Eraian affairs. In a moment, Afina‚Äôs book was already stored away, and hand resting on the pommel of her sword.</p>

<p>The princess caught Elfriede‚Äôs eye, and motioned down towards her sword. Should he find interference to be necessary, she was prepared to support him. She then turned back to the ship, analyzing the crew and its cargo.</p>

<p>There were many factors in deciding to intervene. The last time they had meddled in laguz affairs had been disastrous; would they really want a repeat of Rica? Afina wanted to bury the memory of how ashamed she had felt. Ashamed to have decided to investigate, ashamed of failing in combat, ashamed of relying too heavily on her comrades, and ashamed of the fatalities that had sustained as a result of her weakness. Even if Ransford had praised them for their efforts in the wake of their battle, she felt the detour from their voyage to be an embarrassing mistake.</p>

<p>But she also had a duty to uphold. These very same laguz could be causing mischief and mayhem closer to Callora than she thought. And even if they were not, justice would have to be done to criminals. And no innocent person hides in the dark. Afina‚Äôs grip visibly tightened on her sword.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-03-05</em></p>

<p>Elfriede waved to Afina and Atalantia dissmissively and spoke low. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt our fight nor our problem. We should notify the town authorities and ask them to check it out. If they already know, then well‚Ä¶ there is nothing to worry about.‚Äù</p>

<p>Elfriede smirked. ‚ÄúWe cant go around causing trouble <em>everywhere</em> we go now can we? Besides, theres no notible danger nor any problems; Although I agree that I find it odd. Just because something is out of place, doesnt mean that there is evil afoot. Even if they do plan to suddenly attack the capital tomorrow, a small brigade of rabbits is something I think that the gaurd can handle.‚Äù He lightly pats Afina on the back, ‚ÄúEase up a bit.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2018-03-05</em></p>

<p>Atalantia was hesitant. Sure this wasn‚Äôt our matter, and it would probably be best to tell the authorities, but what if something awful will happen? What if the authorities couldn‚Äôt handle any misfortune that would occur?
Many thoughts such as these, filled Atalantia‚Äôs head. But rather than cause her friends more conflict, she shook the thought off and rolled with it. 
‚ÄúI agree‚Ä¶ Telling the authorities would probably be best. It‚Äôll also allow us to make sure that all I known and in order.‚Äù Atalantia stated.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario, Atalantia was prepared to act if all went down</p>
