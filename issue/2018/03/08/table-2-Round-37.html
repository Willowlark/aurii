            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-03-08</em></p>

<p>Elfriede presents your papers at the dock’s main entrance and a crewman directs you to the right. You soon recognize the dock you end up at; it’s the same dock you were at last night. As you once more snake your way through the walls of crates and barrels you can see some have cut marks in them. Apparently whatever went down last night came to blows.</p>

<p>Men are closing up ports and doing final checks of the prep for launch all over the ship. None stop to bid you welcome. Eventually, a middle aged man in the dress of a Captain comes up to the gangplank, looks over in your direction, then heads across it towards you.</p>

<p>“If I am not wrong, you are Lady Afina Tyndall and escort, correct?” The captain says once he’s reached you. Affirming so with your papers, he nods. “We have two cabins set aside. I apologize, it is all we were able to spare as far as space. The Aster is a large ship, but she’s overloaded with supplies for the city. I’m Uhes Chetlett, captain of the Aster.” he gives a very curt bow to Afina. The man is muscular, but less so than most working on a cargo ship. Elfriede can recognize some military service medals on his jacket, though nothing outstanding. Uhes has no facial hair and dull brown eyes that seem to be thinking all the while you speak to him. He leads you up to the boat and soon your voyage commences.</p>

<hr />

<p>During the first day and half you quickly piece together than the ship jacking you saw was thwarted without too much bloodshed. The sailors had been worried about a delay leaving yet most of the rabids gave in quickly. Many blessing to Lylalel were given for that.</p>

<hr />

<p>The evening of your second day on board comes quickly. From the crow’s nest a crewman calls “Ebonary is out of sight Captain!” and the captain nods.</p>

<p>“And Lylalel shall light our way home.” he says to no one in particular.</p>

<p>“Sir?” the crewman calls again. “We have a ship coming from due west.” The captain quickly turns, his jacket fluttering behind him as he looks over the western rail with his spyglass. The captain looks from mast to mast with his spyglass while his crewman calls “She’s smaller than us, looks Eraian in make. I’d say it’s a warship sir.” The crewman’s relief is audiable in his call.</p>

<p>“And she flies no flag.” The captain growls. He turns and pulls on a bell, which rings on every level of the ship. “I want all hands! I don’t trust that ship!” he bellows. Men scramble about on every deck, many arming themselves. “Helmsman to the wheel, crowman keep us from getting parallel to her!” the captain steps down to the main deck, letting his helmsman take control of the ship.</p>

<p>It’s not too long before the man in the crow’s nest calls “Captain, she’s out maneuvering us! She’ll get along side!”. The captain puts down his glass as the approaching ship turns.</p>

<p>“They have cannons, yet they aren’t using them! They intend to board! Be on your guard!” the captain calls and it sets a dark tone over the men of the crew. Each is now armed and doing their duties with the utmost effort, all while keeping one eye on the encroaching ship.</p>

<p>(ooc: you don’t have to be on deck witnessing the above. That happens, but if your below deck you can spin it as you heard from a crewman who came to tell you, or anything you like. Set yourselves up on the ship in your post.)</p>

<p><strong>Afina (Georgia🍀 )</strong> - <em>2018-03-10</em></p>

<p>Afina nodded politely. “Yes, I am Lady Afina Tyndall, pleased to meet your acquaintance.”  <em>Funny</em>, Afina thought as the captain led them along the boat. <em>Her courtesy training was so second nature that she had responded to the captain without hesitation</em>. The princess had almost surprised herself.</p>

<p>As the captain explained the details of their journey, Afina’s eyes wandered to Elfriede, who seemed to be intently listening to the captain. He seemed to be in a pleasant mood this morning; their conversation and private sleeping quarters must have done the knight well. <em>Good,</em> she thought. <em>Perhaps Elfriede would give more credence to her queen’s guard comment.</em> Had he thought about it? Perhaps she needed to be more straightforward in her offer.</p>

<p>Afina mentally berated herself. How rude it would be to take Elfriede away from his family and culture and duty here! Just because she enjoyed his friendship and advice, did not mean she had the authority to take him from his current situation. She should take the situation as it was; a temporary journey. The princess stood straight as she heard the predicament of the bedrooms.</p>

<p>Afina looked at her companions, gauging their reactions to Uhes’ news as the captain walked away. Elfriede had offered to give Afina her private space; as a princess this was something she was used to. But she decided against it, reasoning that she would rather not be stuck alone in such unfamiliar territory. She glanced between Elfriede and Atalantia. Why had Elfriede carefully avoided the idea of sharing a room with her? He <em>was</em> her escort after all. Perhaps he was feeling awkward from last night, and his own personal space was necessary. Besides, Afina made a point that she would attempt to befriend Atalantia as well.</p>

<p>Afina’s choice was cemented by Elfriede’s accidental bow. <em>The conversation last night must have made him feel conflicted between his mission and his friendship</em>, she thought. <em>He most definitely needs the space</em>.</p>

<p>“That’s quite alright,” Afina nodded. “It’s only natural that the two women share a room. Atalantia, would you like to share quarters?” Afina offered. She was apprehensive; she had never shared space with a laguz before. But perhaps there was a first time for everything.</p>

<hr />

<p>Afina quickly explored the vessel, and finding nothing particularly intriguing the first day at sea, she sat down to write to her father.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Dearest Father, 
How does my letter find you and mother? My company has just departed from Ebonary, a coastal town in Eraia. From here, we travel by boat to the other half of Eraia; Soon we are to stop at Elfriede's residence. Please do make sure that new books and clothes await us upon arrival. They are integral to the journey's success. 
 
Personally, I have seen improvement in my swordsmanship, as well as my fire magic abilities. There has been ample opportunity for learning on the road, and I have ceased every moment of it. I have continued to improve my abilities as a mage, and as a tactician. I have also engaged in diplomacy; I am learning the customs and culture of Eraia, and hope that it will shed light on their methods of international relations.
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Thus far, I believe I have experienced both the positive and negative side of Eraian culture. Though I have been an outsider, Elfriede's assistance has also shown the best of what Eraia has to offer. 
 
In my travels, Elfriede Faun seems to be capable of serving as an advisor, protector, tutor, and friend on this journey. Not only has he successfully performed his duty as escort, but he has provided key advice and assistance in times of crisis. How soon might it be until I can commence building my own staff? If conditions permit, I wish to leave a place for the knight. Though my rule may be a ways away, I have not met a more qualified individual to have among my council.
 
Atalantia, too, is performing well. Her skill with dual blades is unparalleled, and she continues to inquire about the world we have travelled through. Though I'm afraid cultural barriers separate us greatly, I look forward to conversing more with her, and gaining a deeper understanding of her world. Perhaps she may also become a devoted friend in time. 
 
The ship we are traveling on is well-equipped, and the captain has been most courteous in our endeavors. We are slated for a few days of travel, and then we will arrive at Elfriede's home. How is mother? And Master Witella? I hope everyone at home is happy and healthy.
 
Afina
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The princess put down her pencil with a sigh, standing from her desk. The stuffy room was far too warm for Afina’s liking. Maybe the cool ocean breeze would help.</p>

<p>Afina glanced about the room; she had not seen Atalantia since earlier that day. Perhaps she would find the laguz warrior roaming about above deck.</p>

<hr />

<p>Afina leaned on the rail of the deck, watching the ocean waves roll by. The breeze tousled her hair, the ribbon on her blue bow whipping in the wind. It was a peaceful sight; Afina had never been one much for the ocean in Laera. The crewmen roved about lazily as the captain stood at the mast of the ship, gazing through his spyglass.</p>

<p>A sudden commotion on deck made Afina turn around. The shouting between the captain and the crewman in the crow’s nest means that something must truly be amiss. Afina’s hand goes to her sword, the only weapon she carried on her at the moment. She had assumed that they would not engage in combat while on the water; the princess had armed herself mostly out of a desire to look imposing, and her pride over becoming a recent swordsman.</p>

<p>The crewmen began rushing about, arming themselves and bolstering the ship’s defenses. “We’re being… attacked?” Afina wondered aloud. <em>By another Eraian ship, no less.</em> Afina hesitated, glancing between the door to the bunks and the incoming ship. She did not trust her swordsmanship enough to use in true combat yet. She had to acquire her books.</p>

<p>“They intend to board!” rang out across the ship as the captain positioned his crew into fighting stances. Afina ran towards the bunks, weaving through the flurry of commotion that had become the deck. Her heart was beating hard in her chest from the combination of running and fear. <em>Another fight? So soon?</em> It felt like their brush with the laguz was just yesterday.</p>

<p>Afina hurriedly retrieved her books, pausing to consider the implications of fire magic on a boat. Perhaps it was best not to summon fire while resting on, what is essentially, a giant tinderbox. The princess tossed the fire book back onto the bed, clutching her book to her chest. She had elected to leave the dagger as well; her last fight with the dagger had yielded much embarrassment. She would have better luck with the sword.</p>

<p>Returning above deck, Afina opened her book, joining the crewman in watching the enemy ship with vigilant eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-03-11</em></p>

<p>Elfriede nods respectfully to Uhes as he addresses them. Although much of what he was saying was lost on him, as his mind was preoccupied with last night’s events. He thought of the showdown at the dock that had apparently happened the night before. How could a ragtag group get so far? To be able to do something malicious right in the heart of the city? Clearly the city wasn’t as locked down as he believed, which made him all the more relieved to get his friends out of Ebonary and out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>There was also the interaction in his room last night that was clouding his thoughts. He was overjoyed that Afina was taking a liking to him and opening up. But he couldn’t help but wonder how she would feel if she knew the truth. Would she understand? His gut wanted to say yes, as she was a Princess of Laera, one of the most accepting communities in all of Aurii. …But the doubt lingered still. Regardless, the current relationship with his friends made him happy. Something so simple like an embrace, made him realize what he was lacking. He’d have to be content with that.</p>

<p>Faun snapped out of his thoughts as Uhes covered the situation of the bedchambers.</p>

<p>After he brought them aboard and departed from the companions Elfriede spoke up. “If you’d like your privacy Afina, I could probably find somewhere else to sleep. Among cargo maybe?” <em>Elfriede thought about ways to hide himself from someone he would sleep in the same room with. He could probably find a closet to change in or something. As long as he was careful…</em>
“I could also room with Atalantia. Whatever you decide I will honor it.” He gives a slight bow, but then Afina’s words echoed in is mind. <code class="highlighter-rouge">“Feel no need to bow, Elfriede. Though we began this journey as charge and escort, I’m proud to call you a dear friend now. Which means there is no standard for bowing.”</code></p>

<p>“A-ah.. sorry. It has become a bit of a habit.” Flustered, he straightens and awkwardly apologizes.</p>

<hr />
<p>Faun wandered above deck every now and again returning passed Afina’s quarters to check on her. He passed another soldier aboard and gave him a brief salute. The soldier smiled and went on his way giving praises to Lylalel.</p>

<p>“It’s probably about time I check on her again. It’s been a few hours.” He said as he about-faced and returned to her door mere minutes after she exited the other way. She had left the door ajar, so Elfriede knocked lightly.</p>

<p>“Are you in there Afina?” He said as the door swung open from the force of his knock. He stepped in and glanced around spying a small parchment out on the desk. “Did I leave the documents in here? Why would I -”</p>

<p>He stopped as he noticed it was a letter written in neat handwriting. Clearly Afina’s. <em>I really should respect her privac–!</em> Elfriede saw his name in the letter. Curiosity began to overwhelm him. “Maybe if I just read that part.” He felt abhorrent as he picked up the letter.</p>

<p>As he skimmed through it his face felt flush with all the compliments. <em>Why does she feel the need to compliment me for just–</em> …her staff?! Elfriede placed the letter down and ran outside to the boat rail for some air as he was feeling flush. Would he? He wouldn’t just leave his family and country. He had too much built here.</p>

<p>Not wanting to think about it too much he shook his head and decided to look for Atalantia instead.</p>

<hr />
<p>Feeling very cramped and board Elfriede decided to help the crew on the next day with odd jobs. His muscles had yearned to be used as he was always exercising and on the move, especially lately. One of the crew members had cracked a joke which Elfriede chuckled at.</p>

<p>He suddenly heard the cry of a panicked sailor and instinctively glanced around. He drew his rapier and ran above deck to see what the commotion was and stopped when he saw Afina turned around looking out into the sea whilst holding her book.</p>

<p>“What has happened?!” Although as he said it he saw the dark shape in the distant sea and realized what rather… was about to happen. Although he felt he shouldn’t feel this way… Faun felt a tinge of excitement.</p>
