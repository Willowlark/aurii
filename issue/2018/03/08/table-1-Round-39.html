            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-03-08</em></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Side goal: Catch up!
Target: 0(-6) CLEAR!
Pool: 4
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You turn the corner and Desii hasn’t made it half way down the block yet, apparently having bumped into someone and stopping to help them up. She looks quickly to her left and right and notes there are no side streets to run down, just rows of battered brick and wood buildings and the occasional pedestrian. She turns on her heel and flips open her spell book again, legs wide and looking straight at your approach, the distance between you only 20 some odd feet.</p>

<p>“I’m not going back there willingly.” she says, her tone low and controlled. “Do you know what he wants me for? If you do, I can’t believe you’d be so low as to help him. If you don’t…” she trails off, as if considering the possibility you don’t. “Then everything he’s told you is likely a lie.” she says, softer than before. The edge to her voice returns right after.</p>

<p>“Just turn around and leave me be. Magic isn’t meant for combat, but I promise you I can spwan hellfire long before you even nock an arrow.” She says. Her voice isn’t exactly threatening, she doesn’t have the pitch for it. But you can see the fire in her eyes, that she’s drawn her line in the sand and she’s waiting to see if you’ll cross it.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Conflict: Callorian Stand offs
Target: Desii
Pool: 4
- - -
Desii: Hp: ???
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>(ooc: Not so subtle reminder that you can resolve conflicts without combat. The problem here is you are at a stand off. You can earn dice by <em>doing anything to defuse that situation</em>, which could be backing up, cracking jokes, presenting evidence, asking questions, whatever you think will end the stand off. Combat can of course end a stand off as well. Also remember if you give me a list of questions in your post, I’ll consider them asked back and forth rather than in a block.)</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2018-03-12</em></p>

<p>Aldus raises his hands out in front of him in the peace gesture that’s becoming quite natural at this point. His face falls into a expression of sympathy “Desii, can we just talk about this? No one is making you back to him. Truthfully we don’t know much about him, I am simply following a lead.” Aldus frowns at the thought of leaving the man out of his own personal equation, but he would never want someone to stay in - or return to - a situation that is damaging to them. Maybe Desii would know enough to help Aldus without needing to involve Zaimar? Still… there isn’t much time to worry about that now. He doesn’t want to fight, she seems to have her own side of this and he would prefer to not get struck by lightning today… or any day for that matter. “Please let us discuss this, there’s no reason we need to fight today.”</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2018-03-12</em></p>

<p>Nokri picked herself up, checking the inside of her bag to make sure nothing was damaged. There was enough junk to serve as padding that nothing broke yet, luckily. Hurriedly she tried to catch up to the others.</p>

<p>“I had no intention of helping these guys in the first place,” Nokri complained, hoping that Desii would hear her over the ruckus she was causing. “I want <em>nothing</em> to do with them.” Shooting a glare that may or may not just be acting, She shoves her way in front of Aldus and Eliran, putting herself between them and the girl. “You’re Desii?” she asked. Nokri doubted the two boys would ever forgive her after this, but before she proceeded any further she wanted to be absolutely certain this was the girl they were after. It’d be useless to go this far for some random chick, no matter how strong she may be.</p>

<p>“Don’t listen to them! I won’t let you kidnap this poor girl. I know how awful you are, the things you would do to her.” Nokri hoped that the girl would see her as an ally. They could be gal pals. She took out a vial from her bag, already bubbling from being shaken about during the chase. <em>Shall I smash it into the wall, or throw it onto the ground?</em> she wondered, her eyes darting back and forth figuring out the best way to break it so her and the girl could make a clean escape.</p>
