<p>Elfriede’s charge to the under deck is cut off as a tall man comes stepping through, his rabbit ears pressed against the low below deck ceilings. He has scruffy brown hair that covers his human ears and brushed his broad shoulders. While not a muscular build he’s solid and you can tell he’s an accomplished fighter simply by the way he moves. He has brown stubble on  his surprisingly young face, Elfriede can spot guess his age at upper 20’s lower 30’s. The man has three daggers on his left side, and a scimitar on his right. He has scars up his right arm, old and deep. He wears a short sleeve white shirt with a leather vest over top, worn open.</p>

<p>The man quickly scans the downed rear mast of his own ship and the state of the battle on the Aster. He also looks at Afina and Elfriede upon his own ship.</p>

<p>“All hands, hit the burrow!” He shouts, his voice echoing across the water. At once every pirate on the Aster transforms and leaps backwards, using their rabbit traits to reach the gangplanks in a single leap. They cover each other as they begin returning to their own ship. Some of the Aster’s crew press them, but most are defensive at best and are willing to let the Kouneli retreat. Kouneli pound across the gangplanks, making crossing them back to the Aster quite difficult.</p>

<p>The man transforms himself, his laguz form somehow more burly than that of his crew’s. He bounds onto Elfriede, the weight from his forepaws on the knight-lieutenant’s shoulders forcing the knight flat on his back. He leaps off him, oddly enough not driving his hind legs into Elfriede’s prone form, instead kicking off the deck. The Kouneli spins around as he lands, interposing himself between Elfriede and the way he came.</p>

<p>(ooc: Goals have changed now that the pirates are in full retreat: Each of you needs 4 dice successes to escape the ship, in whatever manner you can come up with to do so. If one of you escapes and the other does not, I will be fine with allowing the escaper to forfeit that escape to stay with the other. The ONLY thing that needs to happen to escape is clearing the goal for escape; Haldel does not need to be beaten. You’ll only have one round to make your escapes.)</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-03-28</em></p>

<p>As Elfriede opens the door, he is met face to face with <em>whomst</em> was clearly the captain. He looked on the young side, yet seemed experienced. Faun stumbles backward gripping his rapier hard with his still functioning arm. Feeling had just started to return to his left hand as he felt tingling at his fingertips. Just as Faun began to ready himself the rabbit captain made a call out to his troops, swiftly followed by a pounce that Elfriede hadn’t expected. The Kouneli form was larger than the average, which the knight lieutenant did not compensate for, and he toppled over onto his back with a thud.</p>

<p>Pain throbbed in Elfriede’s useless arm and caused him to yelp. When he realized that the captain had not injured him further and he was confused. Soon after, Faun heard the rumbling of many Laguz feet. <em>He Issued a retreat!</em> Faun shot up and looked to his right, the path being guarded by the captain and soon to be blocked by many pirates. He needed to leave <strong>fast</strong>. He shuffled to his feet and just as he was about to confront the Laguz swarm he saw blonde hair on the upper deck… which of course caught his eye. <em>Afina is aboard.</em> The sight of her gave him hope for the fight and the possibility of escaping. However, he now feared for her life as well.</p>

<p>Faun waved at her and swiftly pointed to the Aster, signaling their return. He sighed heavily at the danger that lay directly before them and readied himself again. He started forward joining Afina heading for the gangplank. The captain growled at them in response. Elfriede started off in a sprint and the captain pounced likewise. Instead of engaging he dodged, he was merely distracting him.</p>

<p>Afina follow him closely towards their only exit. Then came the forces crossing the gang plank, on at a time they poured over and Faun started engaging each one doing damage to each that started to step forward. He was running out of breath, panting heavily, and only had one weapon to fight with. His offence was the same but he lacked his defense. One by one the pirates transformed back drawing their swords <em>They were running out of time.</em> Faun dove into the crowd blocking the way, swinging and stabbing wildly at them while deftly evading. He tagged one in the chest, one the throat and several in the legs. He felt himself slowing down, getting sluggish. At least the way was looking clear. Several of the pirates stepped back fearing the glistening rapier soaked in blood. Only one more <em>experienced looking</em> one blocked his way.</p>

<p>The laguz man smirked at him and came at him with two swords. This one was clearly a veteran pirate. The man engaged him swinging fast left and right. Sweat poured down his brow. Faun could not keep up the evasive maneuvers. In a reckless last ditch effort he threw himself forward after a clean dodge and stabbed upward hard, impaling the unlucky laguz through the stomach. Just as Faun thought he had won the rabbits arm swung upwards with sword poised tip forwards. Which found its way deep into Elfriede’s abdomen. In a panic Faun kicked the man off. His sword slid out with him and Faun’s stomach erupted into a fountain of blood. It was so sudden Faun hardly felt it, but as he stared down at it he couldn’t mistake the sight of his own lifeblood pouring out of his stomach.</p>

<p>He dropped his weapon and his eyes widened. His breath picked up and his heart rate climbed. Faun’s hands shook and his gaze slowly drifted up and met Afina’s stare. “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p><strong>Afina (Georgia🍀 )</strong> - <em>2018-03-28</em></p>

<p>In one fluid motion, Afina conjured another spell, and the upper deck was encased in a flash of white. The fire mage growled as she squeezed her eyes shut, targeting impaired without the use of sight. The laguz woman shot off another fireball in a haphazard direction as the light dimmed, and there was a dull <em>oof</em> as it struck its intended target. The princess had been struck in the abdomen, and tumbled backwards, finally striking the rails that separated the upper deck from the lower deck.</p>

<p>The fire mage hollered triumphantly. “Damn Eraians, aren’t so tough now, hm!?” she laughed, and Afina unsteadily got back to her feet. <em>Gross</em>, Afina thought, fixated on the gap where the laguz’s front tooth should have been.</p>

<p>“Cease these attacks, and you will be tried with fairness and justice in the eyes of <em>Laeran</em> law,” Afina declared, emphasizing her heritage in the hopes that the laguz would <em>finally</em> understand her. “I do not wish for violence.”</p>

<p>“And yet you board OUR boat?” the laguz asks incredulously, eyes wide, hands thrown out to the sides. Afina’s eyes darted to the pages that the mage still clasped in her hands, now far away from her face.</p>

<p>Afina squinted at the mage. “You boarded us <em>first</em>, you idiot!” Afina yelled, growing frustrated with the Kouneli’s ignorance. Her book held in her left hand, Afina charged towards the rabbit woman, right hand unsheathing her sword. The light caught the blue inlays of the blade, and in an instant, Afina felt invigorated with the thought of her kingdom. She sliced upwards at the woman’s outstretched hand.</p>

<p>Though her immediate reaction was to look away, Afina forced herself to watch as the blade bit through the rabbit laguz’s fingers, and sanguine blood flowed freely from the wound. The woman clutched her wounded hand to her chest, and Afina bit back her horror as red blossomed across the pirate’s stained, white t-shirt. Tears welled in the pirate’s eyes, and suddenly Afina had to urge to run away. This violence she had inflicted… Afina wanted it gone. The fire mage opened her mouth to yell at the princess, but was engulfed in a purifying beam of light, collapsing on the floor in a muddled heap.</p>

<p>Afina sheathed her sword, abruptly turning away from the unconscious mage, who would now lack two fingers for the rest of her life because of Afina. The princess wished she couldn’t dwell on it, but the imagery was still too fresh in her mind. A sudden thunk made Afina turn abruptly, running to the railing to see to the lower deck. <em>Elfriede!</em></p>

<p>The Eraian knight had hit the deck with a dull <em>thunk</em>, while some… beast stood over him. <em>A rabbit laguz? He was going after the captain!</em> Afina realized, readying her book to begin casting once again. Now that she had defeated the mages, she was ready to assist Elfriede in conquering the captain. Only then might they be able to leave.</p>

<p>Afina quickly conjured a light shield between Elfriede and the captain to give the knight a chance to stand once more. He had really taken a beating during this fight; he clutched his rapier in his right hand, but his left seemed utterly useless. <em>Had he been pushing himself too hard? Why wasn’t the captain attacking him?</em> Afina’s shield was effective, but there was nothing to stop the laguz leader from ordering his men to assault Elfriede. And, frankly, if he did, there was little chance that Elfriede could resist, in his condition. The laguz, even those on the Aster, began to retreat back to the main ship. <em>Retreat!?</em></p>

<p>By then, Elfriede had gotten to his feet, and begun to wave Afina over. She nodded as he pointed to the Aster. They had to retreat as well, or risk being taken prisoner by the laguz. Afina hurried down the steps of the upper deck, joining Elfriede on the lower. <em>This is the closest we’ve been all fight</em>, Afina noticed. The knight surely liked to make a habit of running off in combat. His injuries showed how overzealous he had become.</p>

<p>Elfriede charged at the captain, and Afina shot him a confused look. “There’s no time to engage!” she yelled, before seeing the Eraian dodge the captain’s advances.  The captain blundered past the two of them, turning around in confusion. <em>That had been a diversionary tactic. Smart, Elfriede</em>, she thought, finally reaching her escort. As he pushed the offensive towards the gangplanks, Afina hid behind him, keeping one hand on his shoulder, with the cool, smooth metal of his armor reminding her that he was present while she fired off miscellaneous light spells.</p>

<p>Afina noticed Elfriede’s ragged breathing, and his slowed movements. It was possible they might not make it to the gangplank in time. And should that happen…</p>

<p>The princess gasped as she no longer felt the cold armor beneath her hand. “Elfriede?” she said, glancing about. More laguz swarmed towards her, and an angry beam of light eliminated them. “Elfriede!” she repeated, as the laguz pirates had seemed to halt their assault on her. Now they gawked, a small half circle opening up not a few feet from the gangplank. Elfriede? “MOVE!” Afina commanded, a crackling ball of light eliminating the throng of pirates. It abruptly extinguished itself as Afina came to the forefront of what had occured. The princess was overwhelmed by the sight in front of her, and had to register each component one at a time.</p>

<p>There was a burly laguz pirate collapsed on the ground. Covered in blood. Two standards swords laid on the ground, one clean, while the other was coated in blood. Elfriede’s own rapier had been discarded, equally sheen with blood. And there was Elfriede, wide-eyed, his hands grasping at his stomach. Covered in blood. His amber eyes met the gray-blue of Afina’s, and a knot formed in her stomach. He looked scared. Elfriede, the confident Eraian knight, looked terrified. “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Afina’s feet moved before she had developed a cohesive plan. <em>Elfriede is hurt, have to get Elfriede.</em> Afina slipped herself underneath Elfriede’s arm, one hand pressed against his back to try to help steady him. He was liable to collapse any minute. <em>Blood. Fix the blood.</em> The princess glanced between her only free hand, which held her spellbook, and back to Elfriede. His shaking hands were doing their best to stem the flow of blood. Afina could feel his breath, quick and warm against her arm as he began to slump over. <em>Get out, Afina</em>. The princess glanced in every direction, but her vision seemed muddled with pirates and their angry, dirty faces wherever she looked. Her eyes went down to her spellbook once more, its pages propped open to that <em>dumb</em> detonation spell that she hadn’t managed to grasp yet. <em>It’s now or never.</em></p>
