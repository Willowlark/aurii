            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-03-12</em></p>

<p>Frantic calls are made from the crow’s nest as you meet up on the deck of the Aster. You recognize them as degrees of rotation; the sailor the crow’s nest is directing the helmsman on how much to turn. The helmsman replies with an strong ‘aye’ every time; every other second is a call out from the man.</p>

<p>It does little good, and everyone on board seemed to know it from the start. The smaller ship is easily able to copy any movement the Aster makes and begins its approach to come parallel to her. Uhes appears behind the two of you.</p>

<p>“I take it by your arms you intend to fight?” He asks rhetorically. “I’ll leave you to your own devices for the most parts, we have not the spare men to give you any special treatment. Here is your crash course.” he says. He first points the masts of the enemy ship.</p>

<p>“The mast men are going to swing over here and disrupt our work as best they can. They’re just the first wave however.” Uhes points to the deck of the other ship, where you can see men prepping gangplanks. “The gangplanks will bring most of their forces. The faster we can get those planks off our ship the better. The mast-men will attempt to keep us from it however.”</p>

<p>“I’d bet my cabin the enemy has an anima mage on them. We need to prevent them from lighting our masts aflame. Once we’re dead in the water there’s no real hope for us. They’ll likely take potshots from the safety of their own ship though.” Uhes grimaces. “If you spot their captain, he’d be an excellent target. Pirates aren’t chaos incarnate, without a leader they tend to fall back.” The enemy ship makes it’s final approach. You can now see that every man and woman on that ship is a rabbit laguz.</p>

<p>“Hell.” the Captain says. He then bellows out to the crew: “It’s the rabid pirates! Stay not your blades men; they surely won’t hold theirs!” He looks back to you. “This group has been a plague for months. They hate Eraians. It’s possible you’ll receive fair treatment due to your Callorian heritage Milady, but… I’d personally rather not see a lady in the hands of pirates.” Uhes says. “I truly mean it, stay not your arms. These rabids are fanatical, they’ll be not swayed by words or bribe.”</p>

<p>Uhes looks up as the mast-men swing over each of your heads, landing on the ship and engaging the sailors of the Aster. “If we can throw enough of their plan to the wind, maybe we can drive them off. Lylalel bless your steel.” he says over a shoulder as he rushes a pirate, and suddenly the deck is a blur of activity. You can hear gangplanks attach to the sides of the Aster and the whoosh of spell craft. The captain had the pirate’s plan down to a T.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Conflict: Intent to Board
Target: 🔒
Pool: 6
- - -
Goal: Gangplanks: 7
Goal: Mast-men: 7
Goal: Sabatours: 5
Goal: Find their Captain: 3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>(ooc: The Target represents what you need to end the encounter. I’m going to experiment with having it unassigned until you complete some of the sub goals, to represent that you can’t win without interfering with the enemies plans first. Every side goal doesn’t need to be completed. I’ll update the target with a number as soon as victory is on the table.</p>

<p>For a further clarification on the side goals; Gangplanks involves unhooking the planks that connect the ships and/or preventing men from traveling across them. Mast-men are simply mooks running about on your side of the ship, targeting them frees up sailors to help keep the ship afloat. Sabatours are mages on the other ship; if you can get to them their defeat (rules wise they’re mooks) will prevent heavy damage to your ship. You can freely sink dice into <code class="highlighter-rouge">Find the Captain</code>, you don’t need to do anything special to do it. Doing so will reveal the captain himself who you can aim to defeat.)</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-03-12</em></p>

<p>Elfriede steadied his breathe to take in all the action around him. The main bulk of the force is coming from the planks. He has got to at least cut one off. He looked to Afina to see how her mental state was. She looked confident which helped ease some of his stress. His mind was going over possibilities of getting them out of this alive, but the only way forward seemed to be to defeat the pirates. It’s not like they have anywhere to run if they lose. The companions have no choice but to be victorious today.</p>

<p>Elfriede felt that same fire in him that he had felt so many times. He nodded to Afina. It seemed as though they were thinking along the same lines, but he felt the need to reiterate when they both knew.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get you somewhere high Afina, so you can give those casters hell.” He shouted over the huge battle that began to ensue. Faun looked over to the staircase that led to the upper deck which was right near where a plank had landed and enemies poured over it. Good placement; he’d have to shut one of the planks down completely to have any real impact.</p>

<p>He looked to Afina and back to the enemies. “Seven of them. Let’s do it.” He drew his dagger into his off hand and sprinted toward the stairs. The two rabbit laguz closest to him were turned around focused on getting to the upper deck. There was too much at stake in this fight to allow them to turn around. Faun slid downward and pierced both of their knees straight through. Both of them winced heavily while Elfriede, continuing his forward momentum, ran shoulder first into the two of them. The pirates being off balanced causing a domino effect on most of the laguz in the way.</p>

<p>“Go!” he shouted back as he jumped onto the plank to engage the pirates currently crossing.</p>

<p>He knew Atalantia would take care of most of the masses of pirates on the ship. The more in one place the better.. and Afina can handle herself, in fact she was most likely the key to winning this fight. Mages in ship to ship combat are the lifeline of battle. Having one gave <strong>huge</strong> advantages that are not always present on the mainland… and they had multiple by the looks of it. Elfriede would hold the masses crossing the planks at bay while Afina took down the casters. Indeed it seemed like the only option. His heart raced from fear of the possibilities and from the excitement of battle.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (Georgia🍀 )</strong> - <em>2018-03-13</em></p>

<p>Afina spared but a brief moment to roll her eyes. <em>There’s never enough men to spare it seems</em>, she thought. With a burst of spellcast, Afina knew she was immediately going to target the other mage. Her own bravado played a role in such a choice, but tactically Afina also knew that taking out the mage could ensure the safety of the ship.</p>

<p>The dull thunk of invaders jumping aboard pushed Afina into action. She and Elfriede exchanged glances, and Afina noticed that the knight looked confident, like that night before they had entered the laguz hideout. “We’ve got to get you somewhere high Afina, so you can give those casters hell,” Elfriede yelled, struggling to be heard over the clash of weaponry. He gestured towards the staircase to the higher part of the ship.</p>

<p>“Agreed,” she nodded, turning the page of her tomes to begin reading.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a plank landed near the entrance to the staircase with a dull <em>thud</em>, making the floorboards of their own ship shudder under their feet. Seven invaders began to cross, barraging onto the Aster in what seemed to be one huge charge. Elfriede took off running, and Afina prepared herself to assist. While the knight had discharged the first few invaders with relative ease, Afina hesitated; <em>Would he need assistance?</em> she thought, watching as one rabbit laguz tumbled into the water, hitting the surface with a loud crash. <em>I guess not</em>.</p>

<p>“Go!” he yelled, and Afina took off for the stairs, mumbling incantations under her breath. A crackling sparkle of light whizzed around her, piercing the arms and bodies of Kouneli caught unaware. She <em>was</em> going to make it to a higher vantage point; It was a strategic necessity. Only then could she find the other mage and defeat them.</p>

<p>A sudden burst of fire from the enemy ship stopped Afina in her tracks and she gawked at the plume of flames. This was far beyond any fire magic she had accomplished in her limited time. And could light magic truly counter such a destructive force?</p>

<p>An overly confident attacker, noticing how distracted Afina was, raised his sword overhead with a yell. The princess noticed such a presence from the corner of her eye and reacted quickly, shoving her book under her arm and unsheathing her sword. The clang of metal rang out as the two crossed swords, the force of which reverberated up Afina’s arm. 
“Cease this violent nonsense!” Afina declared, lowering her sword into a more defensive position. A flicker of hesitation showed across the laguz’s face. Clearly her accent was not that of an Eraian. This meant that she was not necessarily the enemy, but perhaps the youth had decided that he did not care, raising his sword once more.</p>

<p>However, his hesitation had bought Afina the time she needed. A pillar of light shot up from the ground, fully encasing the shocked rabbit laguz in a stream of bright, white light. <em>Well, if the other ship was unaware of my presence as a light mage, they must surely know now</em>, Afina thought, running once more for the stairs as her opponent was left in a heap on the floor.</p>

<p>The princess felt confident. Though swordsmanship was new to her, it seemed that at least her defensive training had been effective. Her finesse with light magic had also seemed to return after their brush with Rica. Afina would say that their odds in this fight were quite well.</p>

<p>Reaching the top of the stairs, Afina squinted out at the deck of the enemy vessel. Perhaps if the fire mage cast another spell she might be able to locate them…</p>
