            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-22</em></p>

<p>You aren‚Äôt a block into Ebonary before a bucket of water is dumped on Elfriede‚Äôs head from a balcony. Not a moment after water splashes over Afina and Atalantia as well. There‚Äôs a shout from over the balcony railing and though you cannot see the speaker the voice sounds like a old woman.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOne must be clean in the cities of Lylalel! Your grime and dirt attracts the shadow of Lyarlel!‚Äù she bellows, and you hear a door slam. Her actions are‚Ä¶ excessive, but you aren‚Äôt bothered by anyone else for skipping the Traveler‚Äôs Inn on your way into town.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ebonary is a busy city even before you reach the harbor. People move from shop to shop on every road, and the three of you are never truly alone. The people seem relaxed, some taking the time to enjoy the fall weather while others continue their work diligently. It‚Äôs not hard to make your way to docks given their size, and the harbormaster‚Äôs office is easy to spot. The easy mood seems infectious as you look over the harbor. The traders who were so worn out on arrival now speak gaily with sailors and other traders, peddling and moving wares from boat to wagon and back again.</p>

<p>The harbormaster calls you in immediately after you knock, reads your paperwork, and sends you on your way. It‚Äôs to miss the massive stack of papers on his desk, obviously the reason for his less than social attitude. He presents you with the iternary of two ships, a cargo ship that can take you aboard tomorrow morning and a military ship with a little more in the way of comforts and security that departs in three days. He lets you know either will take your group, simply present the paper work.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-02-22</em></p>

<p>They walked through the streets in silence, Elfriede preoccupied by his worries, and his two companions analyzing the surrounding town. Suddenly, water splashes over the railing of second-story home onto Elfriede‚Äôs head, and Afina‚Äôs eyes turn to glare at the individual above. She never glimpses the perpetrator; Moments later, water splashes into her own face. Coughing and sputtering, the voice of an old woman above reprimands the group as Afina clears the water from her lungs.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou insolent little-,‚Äù the princess begins, before the abrupt slamming of a door cuts her off. Afina shot a glance at Elfriede, as if to say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù</p>
<hr />

<p>Once they had departed the harbormaster‚Äôs quarters, Afina takes the two itineraries to analyze them. She glances back and forth between the two documents. ‚ÄúHm. Well. While I would appreciate the security of the military ship, it seems that the cargo ship would bring us to our destination much faster.‚Äù She glanced at Elfriede; his face remained unchanged.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI motion that we board the cargo ship tomorrow,‚Äù Afina says, straightening her posture to that of a princess. ‚ÄúAre there any opposed? And perhaps in the meantime we can explore the city.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-02-23</em></p>

<p>Water violently rained on the knight lieutenant which pulled him out of his deep thought. He angrily glanced up at the closing door and then back to his companions. ‚Äú<em>Eccentric old coot.</em>‚Äù he whispered to himself as he eyed Afina‚Äôs questioning stare.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>After the visit to the harbormaster the group had stepped outside to go over the documents and discuss plans.</em> 
‚ÄúI agree Afina, we don‚Äôt need to sacrifice time for protection on a short journey across the sea that is completely surrounded by Eraian territory on all sides. The cargo ship will do just fine.‚Äù
A strange sensation came over Elfriede. They were soon to be back in Lyall. Home. He hoped that his companions felt the same warm feeling that he does when he returns.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAlright we can do some exploring for the rest of the night, but first we should return to bath else the sky open up and dump water on our grimy and dirty souls.‚Äù he recites sarcastically. Some of the older folk were very set in their ways‚Ä¶</p>
