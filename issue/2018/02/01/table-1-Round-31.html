            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-01</em></p>

<p>“My daughter? She was out with her boyfriend for the night at the festival…” he replies, a dozen emotions crossing his face. He turns on a heel towards the stairs only to turn right back around as the door opens behind the four of you. Pounding foot steps are accompanied by a running jump hug from a young girl Eliran recognizes as the inn keeper’s daughter. She’s a tad hysteric but looks no worse for the wear.</p>

<p>“Oh Dad!” she finally says. “Last night was terrible! I was bothered by that jerk’s men again, the one who want you to sell the inn!” Her Father’s eyes narrow, but before he can say anything she continues. “But it’s also wonderful! The second time they got to me, I’d split up with Trent then, a mage not too much older than me came by! She put the fear of god in them, including the boss!”</p>

<p>“That’s…” her father struggles with conflict emotions for a minute. “Good honey, but I’m more worried about you. You shouldn’t haev been involved in any of that.”</p>

<p>“I mean it sucks yeah, but our problem is solved! The mage said if they tried anything else, they’ll have to go through the <em>Sage</em> on Amnesty street first!” she exclaims. Her father’s brows shoot up.</p>

<p>“He’s such a recluse though! Who is this girl?” he says half to himself. “Still, as long as you’re alright.” he says with a soft look into her eyes. She nods emphatically and he accepts her response. He then looks over to you three.</p>

<p>“… What are you still doing here? Clearly I shouldn’t be worried about my daughter, and you still wrecked on my rooms,” he drawls, and hearing about the room gets you a look of shock from his daughter. “So I can call the guard anytime you know? You don’t have any where to be?” he adds, though the threat sounds empty, just sarcastic. He brings his daughter over to the bar stools and they sit down, talking in quieter voices.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-02-05</em></p>

<p>Eliran leads the disgruntled pair to the amnesty street sages door, knocking on it when they arrive.</p>
