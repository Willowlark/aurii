            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-01</em></p>

<p>The day goes quickly, probably because of how exhausted you are. A spot is set aside for you in the garrison for the night and the garrison offers what amenities to you it can. While not the most comfortable the rest is well needed and earned; it comes to you quickly and easily.</p>

<p>When you leave in the morning, Ransford is the one minding the gate. He stands as your group approaches. “You three have caused more trouble in two days than I’ve had here in the last 6 months.” he mutters. Then he pats Elfriede and Afina on the back while nodding to Atalantia. “Thanks. I was getting old, I could feel it.” He steps back again. “Off the record of course. As is the entire debacle, since sir Faun here could afford to avoid that attention.” Ransford opens the gate into Eraia sovereign territory.</p>

<p>“Off with the lot of you. Next time you decide to go do something stupid, you know where to find me.” He says with a smirk and leans against the gate. He makes a motion for you head through the gate.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s a few days travel to Effera after the garrison. For one of the major trade routes you see more soldiers than you do traders, probably owing to route bordering contested territories. You’re able to camp by the natural border that marks the end of Eraia’s sovereign territory, Byland lake. It’s a very pretty lake, but across it you can see camps of soldiers and war tents which doesn’t leave you terribly comfortable.</p>

<p>Your group is stopped once or twice on the road by soldiers with hands on weapons, but upon seeing Elfriede with uniform and insignia they relax and send you on your way. Each warns you to watch for soldiers coming from the east as it’s always possibly they’ll be Drecian.</p>

<hr />

<p>Just after midday of your third day traveling you arrive at Effera. The town is surrounded with a wooden barricade, weathered but surely effective. You’re stopped at the gate again, though the soldier in charge of this gate is far less enthused than Ransford was. He looks over Afina’s paperwork particularly closely before returning it.</p>

<p>“Traveller’s Inn is to the right coming out of the gate.” he says boredly to Elfriede. “Welcome to Eraia, may Lylalel’s light guide you to her in your visit.” he adds to the group before motioning you inside the gate.</p>

<p>Inside is indeed a fairly large inn to your right, immediately attached to the wall side. The buildings you can see down the street are mostly wooden and seem residential. To the left is a stable, presumably for those entering town. There’s a map by the inn, showing you a overview of the city’s layout.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-02-04</em></p>

<p>“Thank goodness we’ve finally arrived.” Elfriede says in a tired voice. He had passed through here a week and a half prior, but with the state of the market in this town he wouldn’t be surprised if no one remembered him. People were constantly in and out. “First things first, now that we are further into Eraian territory there is some basics we’ll need to go over.”</p>

<p>He pulls the group over to the side near the inn. “First, we should avoid any trouble so… that means no mistepping and talking badly about the Fair-Lady. We don’t want to invite trouble where there is none. Most Eraians <strong>are</strong> tolerant of foreigners and understand that not all of them worship Lylalel but talking badly about her isn’t going to get you far.”</p>

<p>He sighs lightly and straightens up as he remembers his next point. “We should be clean in cities. While this is still rather far out from the capital the stigma holds… not that I mind.” Elfriede looks down on himself semi-disgusted with the filth that he’s had to ignore all this time.</p>

<p>“Let us order a bath and a room at the inn where we can store our belongings whilst we shop. A sort of.. hub should we need it.”</p>

<p>Elfriede looked back and forth at Afina and Atalantia making sure they understood. “I was given paperwork specifically for this occasion thus we shouldn’t have to pay for our stay. <em>Then!</em> We can buy supplies for the rest of our journey and Atalantia clothes that fit her.”</p>

<p>Faun nods to them both and smirks. <em>He was more excited to bath then he would admit.</em> He walked passed the map and opened the Inn door looking back to his companions as he held it open. “I suppose one night’s rest here and food might be in order as well to regain our energy.”</p>

<p><strong>Afina (Georgia🍀 )</strong> - <em>2018-02-05</em></p>

<p>Afina folds her arms, inspecting the sign. She had done enough reading in her lifetime to know that, if they wanted to avoid trouble, that they should rid themselves of the grime of their journey. Eraia had many strict observances, and Afina knew of the weight that her visit carried for international relations. Callora and Eraia were in a stalemate of sorts. Callora was, rightfully, offended that Eraia had attempted to expand into their territory many years ago. For the princess of a prominent Calloran nation to be visiting, in pursuit of “learning of Lylalel’s light”… it was unusual, to say the least.</p>

<p>She nodded in response to Elfriede’s warnings. Naturally, they weren’t prominently directed at her; It was Atalantia that they needed worry about. Eraia tended to accept laguz, but also segregated them, which meant their cultural views might not be as comfortable as their governmental policy was. Not to mention, hailing from the tribal lands, Atalantia had much less cultural savvy than the two nobles she travelled with. Afina was worried, but as long as Atalantia managed to refrain from <em>saying</em> anything rude, they would be fine… hopefully.</p>

<p>Grateful to finally be getting a bath on their fifth day of travel, Afina was in accordance with their plan. A quick bath, renting a room for the night, and some shopping was in due order. And clothes… Afina loved her travelling clothes, but she <em>did</em> the regal appearance of her loungewear. She followed close behind Elfriede, peering into the inn behind him. “Agreed,” she said. “This is one of the more comfortable locations that we could spend the night.”</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2018-02-05</em></p>

<p>Atalantia approached their destination while still in her wolf form. Her fur flowed gracefully in the wind, but was soiled with plenty of dirt from their travels.  One could tell that Atalantia was relieved to have arrived because her moaning song had stopped and transformed to one of eagerness and excitement. Despite excitement for the travel to end, Atalantia was still quite embarrassed to show up in a new town with torn clothes on and the fact that her white fur was disgustingly tainted made her skin crawl. While Atalantia was of a tribal nature, she was a strong believer in cleanliness and first impressions.</p>

<p>Atalantia was quite impatient to find a  place to wash up and buy new clothes, but she listened to her friends with the best attention she could muster.</p>

<p>“First things first, I certainly do need to bathe otherwise I will not be able to think straight nor be of much help” Atalantia said while shaking a bit. Clearly she was not one to handle being dirty for long.</p>

<p>“I also see no reason why we all would talk poorly of anyone, unless there was a true reason to do so? 
I also insist that if we all do want to look our best that we find clothing for me as soon as possible. I truly don’t want to embarrass either of you.”
Atalantia stated towards her friends. Atalantia was fairly concerned that her friends were worried about Atalantia’s presence in a new location. She only wished to form the best impressions she could of herself for everyone, and she wanted to continue to build more trust with her friends.</p>

<p>Upon looking towards the Inn, Atlantia was clearly fidgety and desired a bath and good night’s rest.</p>
