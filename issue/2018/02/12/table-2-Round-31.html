            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-12</em></p>

<p>Your inn is comfortable, far more so than the trail or garrison you‚Äôve recently slept in. Be it the down of the pillows or the comforts of a roof overhead you awake well rested.</p>

<p>Not a block after leveling the inn in the morning the three of you hear a commotion going on. As you turn the corner you can see a group of town guard escorting a handful of people through the streets. Peering through the crowd, you can see 3 Eraian soldiers in the center, their armor dented and damaged while their faces are bloodied. One holds one of his arms in the other, and his ally favors his right leg. Behind them in the midsts of the escort are two laguz, one man, one woman, dressed in damaged clothes. They follow after the soldiers with worried expressions. On their exposed skin you can see plenty of bruises and wounds as well.</p>

<p>‚ÄúClear a path, clear a path!‚Äù the lead guardsman shouts. His hand rests on his sword hilt threateningly. ‚ÄúNot much further to the church men.‚Äù he says behind him. Indeed it is not, you‚Äôre not a block away from the stone building.</p>

<p>Following the group to the church you see a priest walk out the main doors as the escort approaches. The Eraian onlookers all part at once, leaving no one between the doors and the escort. The priest steps aside and the escort continues forward into the church. The third man, who was heavily leaning on a guardsman, falls to his knees just inside the doorway. The other two soldiers turn around, look to him, then come to their knees next to him. They begin, of all things, praying. It‚Äôs a few minutes of this strange set of priorities. The guardsman step aside to leave them be, and the priest comes up behind them, resting a hand on the shoulder of the first man to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>The priest steps away, and in another moment you can see the third man slump in his armor. The action sends a sudden chill down your spine. You can‚Äôt help but recognize the life leaving the man. There‚Äôs a quiet moment as the two remaining soldiers clasp a hand on their fallen compatriot‚Äôs shoulders. They then stand, and with the laguz and guardsman head towards the military area at a much more leisurely, if pained pace. The priest steps forward over the dead man, saying words you can‚Äôt make out. Two other men of the cloth arrive from inside the church, and they three of them close the outer doors. The crowd murmurs various phrases and begins to dissipate.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-02-12</em></p>

<p>Elfriede frowns at the display. ‚ÄúThis is not Eraia at its finest.‚Äù, he says low to his companions.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe damn Drecan conflict‚Ä¶‚Äù He looks down and thinks for a bit. ‚ÄúWe should probably move on, the locals here get frequently unsettled being so close to the border, but it has been some time since a drecan set foot here so fret not.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>Afina suddenly turns to Elfriede asking for answers.</em> Faun was shocked to see Afina so suddenly emotional. ‚ÄúThey wanted to die in the church, to offer thier final prayer to Lylalel. Most likely they had fatal wounds beyond repair and were holding on for that moment. ‚ÄòTis not uncommon Lady Tyndall, especially in this town‚Ä¶ so close to the fighting. I‚Äôm sure they considered themselves lucky as most don‚Äôt make it back.‚Äù Elfriede recites it all in a learned, matter-of-fact way, not showing the same emotion towards the event as Tyndall. However, there was also a tinge of sorrow in his voice, as if this was just was something he had accepted. A bitter pill to swallow.</p>

<p>Elfriede repositions his pack, sighs lightly and begins leading the party towards the south gate. 
‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt worry about the injured folk, they‚Äôll be taken care of. Though perhaps we should inquire with the guards on the way out.‚Äù</p>

<p>Faun walks for a bit thinking.
‚ÄúWith all that‚Äôs going on we might want to take the trail through the woods instead of the normal road. I just get a bad feeling‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd never be able to forgive myself if you two got injured in a war you aren‚Äôt a part of.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-02-12</em></p>

<p>Though the princess‚Äô entire travelling party was curious to see what would be made of the injured soldiers, it was Afina‚Äôs lingering that forced the group to stop. The princess gasped as she saw the ragged soldiers, covered in blood and battle damage. <em>Why wasn‚Äôt there a medical mage helping them?</em> Afina thought, scanning the crowd for such assistance. But no one from the crowd stepped forward, instead keeping their distance and gawking at the bloodied men. The lead soldier indicated that they were close to the church, and Afina was relieved. <em>Of course, the priest would have healing powers</em>.</p>

<p>The doors to the black stone church flew open, and the escort party walked inside. A straggling third man falls to his knees with a resounding <em>thunk</em>, and a silence falls over the spectating crowd. The priest doesn‚Äôt move. Instead, the soldier‚Äôs company turns around, joining their brother in arms on the ground in prayer. Afina‚Äôs brow furrows; <em>Why isn‚Äôt anyone helping these men?</em>, she thinks.</p>

<p>Finally, the priest moves, stepping in front of the first fallen man, and reaching out a hand to his shoulder. The movement is brief, and with a soft clang of armor, the man slumps over. Afina‚Äôs hand covers her mouth in horror, as the man‚Äôs compatriots stand, and depart in the direction of the military compound. Afina can‚Äôt take her eyes off the collapsed soldier on the church floor, even as the priest steps over his body. The doors to the church then close, and the crowd disappears.</p>

<p>Afina is left staring at the church doors, even after the commotion had died. Peripherally, Afina hears Elfriede murmur a few words, but her mind was still reeling from the events. <em>Why didn‚Äôt anyone help him? Why did everyone just stare?</em> Afina‚Äôs hands move to hug herself. <em>Why did they just let him die</em>, she wondered, face slowly contorting into confused indignation. <em>How could anyone let their citizens die in such a way?</em></p>

<p>Afina turns to Elfriede suddenly. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù she demanded in a hushed, yet urgent tone. Her eyes are glossy with the threat of tears as she searches Elfriede‚Äôs features for an answer.</p>

<p>With an explanation, the party continues walking towards the south gate. Afina was still angered by the injustice of the Eraians‚Äô actions; Her thoughts were obvious in the heavy, angry gait in her step. <em>Perhaps the tensions between Callora and Eraia make much more sense now</em>, she thinks. Suddenly the elaborate architecture and vibrant culture of Eraia had begun to lose its appeal.</p>
