            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-12</em></p>

<p>Zaimar smiles at your response. He nods as you ask your question, clearly pleased by your enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you take this serious. Desii is around your age, 5 and a half feet tall with short brown hair. She’s got brilliant blue eyes and freckles as well. I expect you’ll find her in her usual outfit, white blouse and her little hip cape, with a standard tunic and pants. The latter are truly unbecoming of the young lady, but no one can deny her reasoning…” he sighs.</p>

<p>“If there’s anything to recognize her by is just how clumsy she is. Brilliant as she is, she can barely handle walking without hitting the floor. You’ll likely recognize her by that more than anything else. She’s a kind soul, underneath her troubled actions.” He pauses for a moment. “She’s a skilled mage even as just my pupil. She might attack you out of fear, but once you bring her back her we’ll clear up any misunderstandings. If it comes to brawl, between her klutziness and your number you should best her. I ask that you of course go easy on her, she is just a girl.”</p>

<p>“Hmm, what else… Ah yes. I can give you a copy of a map that will show you the route through Callora as a whole. I expect, given she’s not the fastest traveler, you’ll head her off sooner than the Eraian border. Ah, I recommend this.” he rummages around in some scrolls for a moment to reveal a map of the Callorian region.</p>

<p>“There’s a town right here, on the Eraian border. As I recall from my last trip to Eraia, every traveler stops in the town for hospitality and rest before hitting the border crossing. The town was very good at remembering who comes through because of it. Head for there. They’ll be able to tell you if you passed Desii or if she’s already crossed the border. The town is called Miyashire.” he points out the town on the map before providing the rolled up scroll to Aldus. At that moment, one of his flasks begins to bubble a bit.</p>

<p>“I have to get back to this lest my tower go up in a plume of smoke, so unless you have anything pressing I’ll be anxiously awaiting your return with my pupil; and my book.” he says with a short bow, before jogging behind to his potion work.</p>

<p>(ooc: You can take yourselves out of town, wrap up any provisions, have any more conversations. I’ll shift you to the next location Thursday.)</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-02-19</em></p>

<p>Before leaving town, Eliran hit the post office to see if anybody needed something delivered to Eraia. As he always traveled, he often offered to deliver letters for people along the way as a method of a small bonus income. Eventually amassing a small bag of letters for places along the route to Eraia and a small bag of money as a payment, he made his way about checking out of town, bidding farewells to the assorted locations he played for as well as a few friends.</p>

<p>He then consulted the local merchant quarter, seeing if there were any caravans or troupes that wouldnt mind an extra body guard, musician, or helping hand in return for a ride in the direction of Eraia. If they wanted to catch this girl, they would need faster transport if possible.</p>
