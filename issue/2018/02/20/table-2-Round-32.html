            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-20</em></p>

<p>Your group heads south, through the woods. There‚Äôs no trail to be found and the trip is rough, especially on Lady Afina. You are able to navigate successfully, both due to Elfriede‚Äôs survival training in basic and Atalantia‚Äôs lupine instincts. You manage to keep it to only two nights sleeping under the foilage.</p>

<p>As you leave the woods you are either blessed or cursed with the sight of a Wyvern flight in action. Across the plains you can see them swooping and diving, dominating the vast plains with their speed. Something seems to be occupying their attention out there though and you are able to continue on your way unimpeded. You put the warzone behind you with only a scare of conflict.</p>

<p>Others entering Ebonary don‚Äôt look so lucky. Some wagons have claw marks in them, some have burns and others barely can be called wagons. What traders you see are miserable, at least those without full sets of guards. There is little laughter or joviality in the caravans you pass. The gauntlet this trade route has become shows it‚Äôs toll on every man and woman traveling it.</p>

<p>Ebonary itself is beautiful. Clearly expanding out from the coast line, the buildings along the coast are wonderful black marble with open balconies and views of the Emati Bay. The buildings directly on the water and expanding out towards the east are more wooden and brick based, but still clearly designed as a permanent home. Of note is a large number of Kissaelain people in the streets, looking ragged and tired. They don‚Äôt bother you, but look on as you pass.</p>

<p>The docks are easily accessible. The docks themselves are massive, with dozens of ships in the port. Some large, some smaller, each vessel has people loading or unloading supplies. You can see the dry docks as well, huge open buildings for building ships in. The dry docks are abuzz with people working on ships. Not a single dry dock is empty; each dry dock contains an in progress ship.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-02-20</em></p>

<p>Upon their arrival in town Elfriede takes a huge sigh of relief. The roads were even more dangerous than when he left for Theonovayne. He hoped silently to himself that it wasn‚Äôt a sign for more devastation to come at the hands of Dreca and also was greatly relieved that he decide to take the group through the woods.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe faster we leave this town and head to Lyall the better. The boat will be at least greater than a day‚Äôs journey once we secure passage, so we will be sleeping aboard a night or two. Passage shouldn‚Äôt be hard to secure via the documents I arrived with; we just need to meet with the Harbormaster soon before he retires for the night so we can leave for Lyall in the morning.‚Äù</p>

<p>Faun‚Äôs eyes briefly locked with Afina‚Äôs, he knew the trip had been hard on her, but wasn‚Äôt sure of her current mental state. He noted the cuts and bruises on all the companions from the harder terrain. It pained him a bit that he had to bring her through the woods, but he had no choice. He had to constantly remind himself of his duty. Faun nodded to her and Atalantia and motioned for them to follow him to the harbormaster‚Äôs office.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe will bathe and rest after, getting this meeting done early is rather important.‚Äù he said more sternly then he intended. Faun hadn‚Äôt fully realized it but he was heavily on edge after glimpsing the destruction the Wyverns were causing on the roads. His instinct wanted to get his companions that he had come to care for as far from the border as he could‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-02-22</em></p>

<p>Afina inspected the travelling caravans as they passed. Miserable, every citizen looked tragically miserable. Blood and battle damage seemed to plague every merchant, and even the citizens that passed looked ragged and tired. The war seemed to be taking a huge toll on Eraia; <em>this</em> is why Laera avoided conflict at all costs. <em>Savages and religious crusaders</em>, Afina thought, <em>Interesting that such individuals would be locked in combat</em>.</p>

<p>Elfriede spoke of their plans for the day, and the princess snapped out of her reverie, her eyes meeting his.  It had been a long two days through the woods; Small scratches and bruises dotted Afina‚Äôs face and arms. Despite her calm exterior, clearly the trek through the woods had thoroughly fatigued the princess. ‚ÄúLead the way. Your directions are best in this territory.‚Äù</p>

<p>Afina followed close behind as they walked through the streets. She had spent much of their voyage the last few days thinking. About Eraia, about the war that raged on right at the border, about her companions. Atalantia had remained her usual self, full of vibrant determination. But Elfriede‚Ä¶?</p>

<p>His stern voice and set jaw gave his emotions away all too well. Elfriede was clearly on-edge, if not a bit anxious. Afina glanced down, noticing his hand tensing over the hilt of his rapier. <em>Even in friendly territory?</em> she thought, eyes back to analyzing the knight‚Äôs face.</p>

<p>She placed her hand on his forearm. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll arrive at your family‚Äôs residence soon.‚Äù</p>
