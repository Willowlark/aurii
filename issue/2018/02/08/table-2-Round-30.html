            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-08</em></p>

<p>The town of Effera is small enough a few signs is enough to navigate you on your way to the markets. On your way, you pass through the church plaza at the center of town. The two story church is larger than any building in the area, and as tall as the watch towers along the walls. Your parties foreigns had heard about the black stone churches of Eraia, but there‚Äôs nothing quite like seeing one. You both feel pulled into the shadows of the architecture and released by the sun‚Äôs rays on it‚Äôs highlights. The building is in stark contrast to every other building in the town, stone and intricate while everything else is wood and simplistic. The contrast only adds to the grandeur of the building. It‚Äôs rather amazing how the massive building can feel both warm and cold at the same time.</p>

<p>You can see the market down the next long street to to the southeast. It‚Äôs an odd thing, it‚Äôs more like an open area the town‚Äôs buildings where over a dozen of trade caravans have parked their wagons. Traders lounge about around unlit fire pits, swapping stories and wares on occasion. You can see some more local folk walking around and mingling with the trader‚Äôs as well, looking in the backs of wagons in a very casual shopping experience. It gives the feel of a rest stop or bazaar rather than a market.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-02-12</em></p>

<p>After buying their much needed provisions, weapons, and clothing, and exploring the little slice of Eraian culture, the group returned to the inn for much needed rest. Elfriede went through his normal routine of removing his armour and readying himself for bed. He layed down in the comfiest bed that he had been able to sleep in since Tyndall tower. It wasn‚Äôt the best, but it felt like a cloud after all the trials they had been through in the last week or so. Faun fell asleep only moments after laying down.</p>

<p>Later that night, Elfriede was awoken by a russeling sound. His training had made him something of a light sleeper. He cracked one eye to see the sillouette of Afina getting up out of her bed and leaving the room. He sighed lightly to himself thinking he should go after her, but was paralyzed by how tired he was.</p>

<p><em>I guess she desereves some alone time. And what better time then now‚Ä¶</em> He reasoned to himself as he drifted back to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-02-12</em></p>

<p>The culture of Eraia seemed vibrant despite the small size of the trading town. Through Elfriede, Afina was able to interact with the locals, and hear about the culture of the foreign country. Afina almost wondered by tensions continued to be high between Eraia and Callora. Her choice to visit Eraia had been a bold one, but thus far she didn‚Äôt regret the decision.</p>

<p>Afina returned to the inn fatigued, but excited from her adventures of the day. The princess changed into her nightgown and climbed into bed. On either side of her, Afina‚Äôs companions had already fallen asleep, but she laid there, her mind racing. There were huge implications for foreign relations to be made about her voyage to Eraia. She couldn‚Äôt disappoint her kingdom.</p>

<p>Afina sat up from bed, shoving her feet into her boots, and walking briskly to the door. She opened it gingerly, hoping not to disturb Elfriede and Atalantia. The door closed with a gentle <em>thunk</em> and Afina cautiously walked down the hallway to the inn‚Äôs main lobby, a book shoved under one arm.</p>

<p>In the main room, the innkeeper had disappeared, replaced by a small bell that was to be rung should a guest require something. Afina sat in one of the high chairs near a window, the light of a nearby candle illuminating the blank page of the notebook. She poised to write, but found trouble thinking of what she wanted to convey.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Dearest Father,
A further update on the status of my travels, I have successfully arrived in the city of Effera. It is a small, quaint city, and a respectable place to become accustomed to Eraian culture. There are many strict observances here, though Elfriede possesses enough cultural capital to guide us effectively through his country‚Äôs customs. 

Elfriede is proving to be, in fact, a most formidable knight and escort. He had offered valuable insight into Eraia, and also begun instructing me in the use of the sword. I confess that I have no gift; a swordsman such as yourself must recall what it was like to learn what I am now learning. It is proving quite the challenge, but I believe in Elfriede as a teacher. 

Atalantia, as well, has been making a valiant effort to understand Eraian culture, much to my surprise. She is honest in her intentions of comprehending the world around her. I'm afraid there are some things she will never make sense of, but I respect her efforts in trying. 

The journey has been relatively quiet since we left the Eraian military checkpoint. Our days consisted of mostly walking and training, though we have also been able to exchange stories of our experiences while on the trails. Suffice to say, I have learned much from our five days of travel already. 

I hope that these experiences will prove valuable to the people of Laera. Has the country begun preparations for the next festival yet? I was hoping to be able to visit for such a celebration; I believe if would be of utmost importance that the kingdom is reminded of its princess in these turbulent times.

<p>Afina signed her name at the bottom of the notebook, before closing it. Hopefully she would remember to mail it in the morning. She rested her head on the windowsill, staring at the moon in the clear night. It was comforting to know that the very same moon stood high above her, spread light over the people of Laera Soon after, the princess herself dozed off, head and arms still resting on the window sill.</p>
