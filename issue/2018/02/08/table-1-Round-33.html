            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-08</em></p>

<p>Zaimar listens carefully, literally turning an ear towards Aldus as Aldus tells his story. He nods at the end of it, almost as if he were on auto pilot. You can see him frown slightly and his brows furrow as he thinks for a moment. Finally he stops leaning against the wall, placing his hands down on the table in front of him and leaning over to look at you.</p>

<p>“You have… both excellent and miserable luck.” he starts. “I am aware of that book. The potion work you see on this very table is another potion by the same brewer. His works all related to the mind in a way, and it earned him scorn by others who didn’t understand the minds of men need healing as much as their bodies. It is in that sense, you have excellent luck.” he says.</p>

<p>“Your miserable luck is due to my apprentice. You see, she stole this book from me naught but last night. I begrudge her not, she is young and the youth are prone to foolish actions.” he lifts his hands from the table, turn around to look at his bookshelves. “But I care a great deal about her; as an sage is prone to. I certainly don’t think she is ready to be out roaming the world. And even beyond that, I can’t have everyone stealing my possessions. It sets a bad precedence, don’t you think?” he says over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I have a good feeling she’s headed to the west; towards Eraia and their light magic monastery. She’s a prodigy with anima magic and she’s been talking about branching out to light spells for years. I’d like to broker a deal with you.” he turns around, standing tall with an amiable smile and his hands clasped behind his back. “If you can retrieve my wayward apprentice and my stolen property, I’ll do everything in my power to brew that potion for you. As you can see,” he waves an arm at the table before him, “it’s not the first time I’ve crafted potions from that brewmaster. It’s truly important to me that young Desii get back to me safely…” he finishes.</p>

<p>“What say you?”</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2018-02-12</em></p>

<p>“W-wait…. Really?” For a second Aldus can’t believe what the man has just told him, sure it’s not an instant solution to his problem, but it more than he’s had to go on in…. well - in forever. He doesn’t wait for the other two to reply. Sure, having them along for the trip may come in handy but… well if they don’t want to come with him he’ll make due, this was simply way too good of an opportunity for him to pass up.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes of course I will look for her and for your book! What does she look like? Which city is the light magic monastery in? What path do you think she may have taken? Any information you have that would come in handy - even if it’s just speculation - would be appreciated.”</p>

<p>Aldus feels more excitement than he has since he left Wynne. <em>Finally - a real lead, perhaps if this all works out - I can go home, maybe they’ll accept me again. Maybe- maybe Layda would</em> - he visibly shakes his head, dispelling the thought <em>No</em> he tells himself firmly.</p>

<p>“I will be glad to help you, and you help me in return!” He smiles widely and earnestly at the man.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2018-02-12</em></p>

<p>The sound of someone else stealing her client made Nokri frown. It was great that she wouldn’t have to do all the work, as some potions are a pain to make and one as obscure as this was sure to be a headache to mix. But it made her travels up until now rather redundant and she regretted ever getting involved.</p>

<p><em>What other potions are in that book?</em> she wondered, piping “what is that there potion on the table for?” If it was anything valuable, taking a chance to get that book for herself might not be a bad idea. <em>If the apprentice ran away from home she must have had a good reason to say good riddance. Maybe the sage is an overbearing freak.</em></p>

<p>“What kind of person is your apprentice?” Nokri tacked on after Aldus asked of her appearance. They would need to know this information to find her. And if Nokri could find and befriend her first, maybe she could obtain the book and its contents for herself as well.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-02-12</em></p>

<p>Eliran rubbed his chin, he didn’t have any particular reason to go hunting for this girl, however, he was already Eraia bound, and he would like to thank her for dealing with the thugs.</p>

<p>Hearing a much quicker response from Aldus, Eliran thought to himself how helpful it would be to have some traveling companions as well, even if Nokri didn’t seem any more worthy of trust than an unreputable mercenary.</p>

<p>“I am willing to help look for the girl and your possesions, I’m on my way to Eraia for a competition anyways.” Eliran finally responded, “As a question, are there any things about her we should be wary of? I mean she did steal from you.” He asked tacking on after Nokri. If she was potentially dangerous, they would need to be ready to fight her just in case.</p>
