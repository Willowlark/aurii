            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-26</em></p>

<p>Ebonary gives you a much better welcome after a bath. The night is bustling in the town, the docks don‚Äôt seem to sleep as lantern light fills the area. The harbor shops district is alight as well, the Ebonary night life a necessity given the hours many sailors keep. And many sailors there are indeed; everywhere you go you see sailors taking in the land before heading out to sea.</p>

<p>You can see so much more of Eraia‚Äôs culture in the night at Ebonary than Effera. Every building has a single light in it you can see easily from the outside, each a snow white candle burning brighter than you feel it should. Black marble buildings dot the city, most of which are related to the church or military. Soldiers patrol rather frequently, especially around the bars. You can see at least one man being dragged away by soldiers in your evening out, swearing that he ‚Äòwould never swear against Lylalel‚Äôs name‚Äô.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a pleasant evening about, truly Eraia at it‚Äôs finest. It‚Äôs never dark in the site, even in the presence of the black marble Eraia‚Äôs churches are defined by. The darkest you saw was a corner of the docks, while walking along an overlook showing the docks and the bay. It is a tad odd, given you hadn‚Äôt seen a single dark dock elsewhere along the the bay; especially not a dock with a ship in it. The rows of crates and barrels blend together in the dark, forming a miniature maze of sorts on ones way from the staircase down to the docked ship.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-02-28</em></p>

<p>The evening was relatively peaceful, Elfriede calmed down a bit and suggested that they get food at a place a bit more upscale. He took the party to an inn where they enjoyed exquisite meal and eachothers company.</p>

<p>Some time later after leaving the establishment they wandered the city a bit and came to the dock area (which admittedly took up a large portion of the city). Elfriede took a lackadaisical look around and saw that one of the docks lights were out which he squinted at as odd, but chose to ignore it as they did not need any more distractions right now by his thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2018-03-01</em></p>

<p>Atalantia thoroughly enjoyed the new cuisine. It wasn‚Äôt quite the comfort food of hunted meats that she was used to, but there was a certain texture and flavor that appeal to her. Atalantia also enjoyed being able to spend the evening with her friends once again.</p>

<p>Atalantia looked towards the darkened dock along with the rest of the party. Something didn‚Äôt seem right to her, ‚ÄúHey, is that normal?‚Äù Atalantia pointed at the dock while she asks her friends in hopes that they‚Äôd be able to give some sort of clarification. 
Shortly after asking the question, Atalantia stepped forward towards the darkened dock in order to get a better look.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-03-01</em></p>

<p>Ebonary seemed to truly come alive in the night time. The sailors and townspeople alike bustled around the town, the bright light coming from every inn and store lighting their way. People chattered, laughed, and cheered as the nightlife of the Eraian town was vibrant and joyful. Sailors had to have their last bit of fun before shoving off, after all. Even Afina loosened up, smiling and waving politely at the townspeople. Atalantia too, caught attention from the night life; a few sailors hollered and whistled at the passing laguz woman. Nevermind the fact that her muscles and strength rivalled their own. Afina might have been approached as well, had her shy attitude and her close trailing behind Elfriede not kept the suitors at bay. Though the night life was welcoming, the unfamiliar territory still had Afina on edge.</p>

<p>After dinner, the three of them walked along on the docks, in a most quiet and peaceful manner. All the docks were lit by ‚ÄúLylalel‚Äôs light‚Äù‚Ä¶ except for one. Elfriede seemed intent on avoiding the dock, but Atalantia had already stepped forward to investigate. As the wolf laguz began to investigate, Afina placed her pack on the ground and pulled out her light magic book. She had been practicing with fire magic for most of the week, hesitating on opening the binding of the thick book.</p>

<p>Shaking off the feeling, Afina opened the spell book, and a small beam of light glowed over Atalantia‚Äôs head. If the wolf laguz wanted to explore, the least she could do was assist. They had already been separated from Atalantia once, after all. Afina navigated the ball of light to lead Atalantia, its luminescent intensity casting shadows from the cargo across the docks.</p>
