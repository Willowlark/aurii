            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-02-05</em></p>

<p>It’s not hard to miss the tower on Amnesty Street. Much like the rest of Evard’s architecture the white stone and smooth edges dominates the appearance of the at least 3 story tower. Ivy hangs and grows all around the upper levels, going as high as the roof. It’s been landscaped, if you can use that term for it, to have no ivy with in arm’s reach. This makes it stand out from other buildings where ivy falls around doorways and windows.</p>

<p>When you knock you hear nothing for a while. Just as you start to think no one’s home you hear a disgruntled “oh right” and begin to hear footsteps. Coming the door is a tall man with black hair. His frame is wirey and adds to his age, making him look flimsy. He wears a black robe over his house clothes and his hair is unkempt. He cocks an eyebrow at your group. Thinking for a moment, he makes his decision and steps aside.</p>

<p>“I assume you have something you wish to discuss? You’re an odd lot so I’ll listen, have a seat in the parlor.” He says.</p>

<p>His parlor area is more bookshelf than parlor, but it’s not hard for you each to sit. He steps behind a massive table on side of the room and fiddles with some of the many supplies on the table. After a moment he finishes and leans back against the bookshelf behind him.</p>

<p>“Well hello. I am Zaimar, Sage on Amnesty and I have no idea who you three are. What brings you to my home.” he says with a nod of his head indicating you should speak up.</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2018-02-08</em></p>

<p>Following Eliran to the Sage on Amnesty Aldus tries to calm himself down from him and Nokri’s blow out. He really just couldn’t wrap his head around what kind of person Nokri was. She didn’t seem to care about anything or anyone, but she agreed to help anyway. But when the opportunity at information arose she passed it up, why was she traveling with him if she didn’t actually want to help? She could have just stayed in Theonovene or gone her own way. His mind runs around in circles trying to reason out why Nokri would be the way she is, and thinking of a million better comebacks now that the fight was “over”.</p>

<p>Before he realizes it they are at the Sage’s tower. As the person who requested to meet The Sage, Aldus finds it appropriate that he’d be the one to knock on the door. When a spindly, older man with dark hair answers the door promptly inviting them in, Aldus is taken aback for a minute <em>Well he sure seems more welcoming than I had expected</em> he nods, muttering a small thank you as the three of them shuffle into the space that is overcrowded with books. He takes a seat, and a moment to collect himself making sure there is no leftover animosity in his voice.</p>

<p>Aldus takes a deep breath and begins to explain “I suppose there’s no sense in beating around the bush, I might as well get straight to the point.” He pauses for a second thinking how he wants to go about explaining his issue. “Well, as you can tell I’m wolf laguz but even though I am well past the age, I’m still unable to use my wolf form. I’ve tried many different remedies back in my homeland, but I ran out of options. My… acquaintance here tells me she’s heard of a solution for this but only in a book she no longer possess. So upon hearing that there was a sage here, and that you had quite the collection of books, I had to at least try. Would you happen to know of a potion, or herb, or even a type of magic that could help me?”</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2018-02-08</em></p>

<p>Nokri stalked the duo from a distance of several paces, still seething. The fact that they both had valid points just made her angrier, and she was enraged that they had called her out. Walking through the bustling town did little to soothe that, but it did give her time for introspection.</p>

<p><em>They should be thankful I’m following their sorry butts around,</em> she thought bitterly. Maybe she was treating them a little harshly, the complete opposite of how she normally treats her clients. But Eliran wasn’t her client, so her opinion of him was hard to budge. <em>If it stops their darn complaining I can act a little sweeter. Ugh. They better be grateful.</em></p>

<p>The sage’s house was pretty neat, Nokri enjoyed looking at it and the way plants only wrapped around the upper floors. Whoever owned this had money. She slipped inside after the boys, doing a little curtesy now that they were in the presence of someone cultured and well-respected.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t happen to know the location of such a book either, would you good sir?” she inquired after Aldus laid straight their reason for visiting.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-02-08</em></p>

<p>Eliran kindly thanked the old man, and gestured to Aldus when they arrived, since he didn’t actually know what they needed.</p>

<p>Eliran then spent most of the time looking around at the Sages quarters, they were really something. He thought back to the girls story of how she was saved, <em>didn’t she mention somebody young helped her?</em> he thought, <em>maybe he has an apprentice</em></p>
