            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-04-02</em></p>

<p>Thankfully, the rest of your trip to Lyall is uneventful. The medical staff of the ship aren‚Äôt equipped with the level of magecraft required to truly heal Elfriede but they easily stabilize him over the remaining week at sea. The crew gives your group a wide birth; your deeds in the fight are talked about in whispers.</p>

<p>As you go to step off the docked ship, the Captain looks to you. He simple nods and utters a ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù in the same simple, focused way as always. Then he turns back to his business with the same gusto you‚Äôve seen him with all trip.</p>

<p>Lyall is a massive city. Even from the bay you couldn‚Äôt see the far end of it. The most prominent thing on the Lyall skyline is a massive lighthouse, set a few blocks in from the coast. Afina actually saw it from the boat the day before, but none of the crew pointed it out as anything less than a star in the night sky. The tower is black marble, and at least as tall as Laera‚Äôs castle towers. It‚Äôs light is warm and inviting, despite the deep shadows of the black stone.</p>

<p>Lyall is in fact, made more of black marble than not. It‚Äôs a city in the grandest form, multi story buildings in every direction. Second to the black stone is stained glass, almost every building you can see has large windows of stained glass which colored light pours from. Purple and bright white highlights adorn the city in a strange mix of colors, with warm orange light mixing to keep the place from looking like a painter‚Äôs nightmare. Lyall‚Äôs streets are wide and allow the light to play on the cobblestone.</p>

<p>You come off the ship to a busy port, given the Aster is a cargo ship you disembarked on a shipping pier rather than a commuter pier. From where you are, you‚Äôll have to head west along the water before turning north west up towards Faun Manor. It‚Äôs not a short walk.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-04-04</em></p>

<p>The next few days aboard went slowly for Elfriede. Being on a boat with no activity was bad enough, but being bedridden long enough to think about your mistakes is another. The only activity he had during his time was reading and his daily chats with Afina when she brought him his breakfast and supper. Some conversations were fun and enlightening while others were a bit awkward with them trying to avoid the combat incident topic.</p>

<p>On the final morning Afina helped support him while he attempted to walk again. There was some intense tightness in his stomach, but he finally managed to walk on his own. He definitely wouldn‚Äôt be fighting or traveling for several days at least.</p>
<hr />
<p>When they arrived at port Afina had left the boat ahead of him, semi-eager to get off and look at the city. He had changed into civilian clothes and was no less eager. He‚Äôd had enough of this boat to last a year at least. After he said farewell to the captain and was about to step down the boarding plank, his upper arm was lightly tapped by an excited sailor.</p>

<p>He leaned in and spoke with respect. ‚ÄúThank you for all that you both ‚Äòave done. Who knows where we‚Äôd be without you two.‚Äù he paused for a moment. ‚ÄúThat girlfriend of yours really gave this one pirate hell. I saw it! Hit ‚Äòem with ‚Äòer book and knocked him right dead she did. That‚Äôs a tough one you got there! Best not to let ‚Äòer go.‚Äù</p>

<p>Elfriede nodded to him and smiled as the man went back to his duties. He wasn‚Äôt about to get up in arms over a misunderstanding. Besides‚Ä¶ <em>Afina‚Ä¶</em> <strong>killed</strong> someone? That doesn‚Äôt sound right‚Ä¶ Maybe‚Ä¶ <em>Could it be she doesn‚Äôt know?</em>
Elfriede thought it best to keep it to himself even if she <em>did</em> know. She probably didn‚Äôt want to be reminded. He shook his head and walked down to join her.</p>

<p>Afina, in high spirits, locked arms with him and suddenly pointed to the lighthouse asking him ‚Äú<em>what it was for?</em>‚Äù with stars in her eyes.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAh, believe it or not, it‚Äôs a military building. Odd I know‚Ä¶ the few foreigners we get visiting here always find that a bit strange. They have meetings there of high importance at times, while the bottom floor is a museum of sorts! I‚Äôve never been to the upper floors, but it is a beautiful sight and a sort of‚Ä¶ symbol to us.‚Äù</p>

<p>He smiled hoping the short description answered her question, and brought them over to the harbormaster area.There he paid a messenger service to deliver his rapier and armour to his home. He also sent them with a message that he‚Äôd return later with company. The two then proceeded to the bathing house which was much grander than the previous towns. Elfriede bathed, being careful of his wound, which was closed, but far from fully healed.</p>
<hr />
<p>After bathing, he had switched to civilian clothes and walked slowly as to not hurt himself more. Once Afina returned, he nodded to her once she came over. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say we‚Äôll spend a bit of time with me showing you around wouldn‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù</p>

<p><em>He was interrupted by his own growling stomach.</em> He broke eye contact a bit embarrassed. 
‚ÄúA-ah but perhaps we should get something to eat first? Just thinking of anything other then the food we had at sea‚Ä¶ I could do without that food for a year or two.‚Äù</p>
<hr />
<p>After dining, Elfriede secured them a horse driven carraige to be taken around the city to various locations before finally settling at his family house in the afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-04-05</em></p>

<p>Afina spent much of her days about the ship studying and reading. It was nice and peaceful on ship, the perfect place to study. She had read over her light magic and fire magic instructions at least a thousand times each, and spent the days practicing her magic on deck. The sailors didn‚Äôt bat an eyelash; After the events of the battle, no one seemed to question the princess‚Äô practice sessions.</p>

<p>During the night, Afina occupied much of her time with talking to Elfriede. They exchanged stories of their childhood, and of cultural norms in their respective countries. Sometimes they joked, but often they simply skirted around the topic of the pirate invasion that had occurred days prior. The morning of their arrival in Lyall, Afina helped to get Elfriede back on his feet once more. The knight was unsteady, but managing. <em>There goes being a protector, hmm</em>, Afina thought.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the boat dropped its anchor at the port, Afina was the first to leave the boat. She had seen the most astounding architecture from the ship. Black marble and stained glass shimmered in the sunlight, towers and spires reaching high into the sky. Afina gawked at such marvelous structures, their design so different from that of Laera. The coastal breeze tousled Afina‚Äôs hair, and made the blue chiffon of her dress flutter in the breeze as she took in the view of the city from the docks.</p>

<p>Most of all, it was the lighthouse that caught Afina‚Äôs attention. ‚ÄúElfriede, can we-,‚Äù she started, turning around, only to realize that the knight lieutenant was several paces behind her, still on the ship. ‚ÄúElfriede, are you coming?‚Äù she called, waving her hand. Elfriede smiled, dismissing a sailor that must have been saying his final ‚Äúthanks‚Äù for their help in battle. It seemed like every crewman had wanted to say thanks at one time or another. Whether it had been spoken, or expressed through a kind gesture, the sailors did not seem to want to admit it, but the travelling nobles had proved to be essential to defending the ship against the pirates.</p>

<p>Elfriede nodded, making his way down the gangplank. Afina locked arms with him in the typical escort fashion, her free hand pointing to the lighthouse. ‚ÄúWhat is that for?‚Äù she asked, mesmerized by the array of colors that topped the soaring black marble structure.</p>

<p>In turn, Elfriede explained that the lighthouse was actually a military installation. ‚ÄúHow interesting‚Ä¶‚Äù she said slowly, glancing up and down the lighthouse. It looked so beautiful; Afina was glad to hear that at least half of it was for decorative purposes. A museum seemed the most respectable usable. Such a beautiful exterior‚Ä¶ Afina was a little disappointed to hear that the military used it. She did no have time to ruminate on such facts, however, as she was quickly ushered to the bath houses. The princess had to admit, she didn‚Äôt mind the mandated bathing after so long spent at sea.</p>
