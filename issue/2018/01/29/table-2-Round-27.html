            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-01-29</em></p>

<p>Between the hunger you begin to feel and the sun rising well past the window in the medical room you get the distinct feeling it‚Äôs getting quite close to noon. Before Elfreide and Afina can make any endeavor to scrouge up lunch for themselves, a mousey haired young man knocks on the door and peers in.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMilady, Sir Faun. The Commander has returned, we‚Äôd hope you‚Äôll be willing to join us?‚Äù he says, motioning for you to join him. He leads the way with a leisurely skip in his step.</p>

<hr />

<p>A knight in heavy armor comes up slowly behind Atalantia. He is sure to be loud enough Atalantia can hear him, lest the whirling blades come for his neck.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMiss? The Commander has returned from the camp. He‚Äôd like you to join us in the mess.‚Äù He says from a few dozen paces. He waits patiently before guiding the laguz back towards the outpost.</p>

<hr />

<p>The knight and mousey haired boy time their trip well, they lead the two groups to the mess hall doors at the same time while coming from opposite directions. They each push open a door and inside you can see the entire company gathered, whooping wildly as Narder stands at the head of the room, downing a mug of beer. Your guides filter into the room, grouping up with friends and joining the modest feast in the room. Every table is decorated with meats, breads and cheeses; all prepared like they aren‚Äôt rations for a military garrison. Beer and wine is ever more prevalent, with in reach no matter where you sit in the room.</p>

<p>Ransford steps up next to the three of you. For the first time you see him without his armor, though you can tell by the bandages that it‚Äôs only because he was just being treated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say successes should be celebrated.‚Äù he says. He gives you a wry smile. ‚ÄúWhile I haven‚Äôt forgotten it‚Äôs your fault we had a problem in the first place‚Ä¶‚Äù He motions to a man who brings up a pair of mugs and wine goblet.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou certainly were instrumental in solving it. Cheers you lot.‚Äù Ransford says with a raise of his own mug. At the word cheers the rest of the room seems to start paying attention, clanking glasses and hollering gaily. ‚ÄúEnjoy the festivities. No point leaving with half the day gone.‚Äù He turns to leave but stops; pointing at Atalantia. ‚ÄúI know for a fact some of the men want to talk to you wolfie. Something about being bewitched by a Bladedancer?‚Äù he says, rolling his eyes at the apparent nickname you‚Äôve been given. With that the Commander returns to his own chair, falling heavily into the seat and resuming his conversation with Narder and a few others.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-02-01</em></p>

<p>Elfriede gathered his things togethor a few hours after after thier training sessions and was prepping for the journey south. He smiled lightly at his companions. Although he knew that they had some trials ahead, Faun and his strong companions would handle anything that gets thrown at them with heads held high. He packed his bag and removed his armour to get ready to sleep for the night. 
Elfriede left and returned after changing into his sleeping clothes, and massaging his cramped tail. He got in bed and blew out the candle that was at his bedside.
As he layed down in the provided bed he heard his companions do the same.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-02-01</em></p>

<p>Afina unloaded her pack and laid its contents on her bed. She took stock of all the items that she had brought with them, before repacking the bag and placing it by the doorway to the room that the group shared together. Changing into her nightgown, Afina sat on the edge of the bed, deep in thought. <em>At least today had proven that her company could work well together</em>, she thought, turning over her light magic book in her hands. She had a couple low-level fire spells for the road, ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from a book in the outpost. They would have to last for the journey to Elfriede‚Äôs residence.</p>

<p>Afina‚Äôs ears perked up as she heard the covers rustle, and a light snuffed out as Elfriede blew out the candle on his bedside. Afina glanced at her own candle, wavering and dancing in the night. <em>Fire, hm? It would be an interesting magic to learn, to say the least</em>, she thought. The princess crawled from the edge of her bed to the pillow, burrowing under the covers. The outpost beds were by no means comparable to that of home, but Afina got as cozy as she could. It was interesting, and in a way, comforting, to hear the minute movements and noises of her companions. At Tyndall Tower, it had been only her, and the silence was almost eerie. She bid her company goodnight, and blew out the candle on her bedside.</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2018-02-01</em></p>

<p>Atalantia was still disappointed in her abilities during training that afternoon. Perhaps she strained herself too much with the fight from Rica? Or maybe she had a lot more to learn than she originally assumed.</p>

<p>Atalantia prepared her blades and got ready to rest. She was looking forward to the adventure ahead.</p>
