            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-01-25</em></p>

<p>The split up men are much easier to avoid, ironically enough. You can get around them easily and with your masks you almost don’t have to avoid them at all. The inn is, as Eliran promised, just beyond the circus tent. You work your way through through the packed line of people waiting to enter the big top and leave the fairgrounds unimpeded.</p>

<p>The inn is… less reputable than the one you arrived at before. It’s location is definitely it’s primary draw, with balconies overlooking the fair ground off the second floor rooms. The rest of the building is historic, or at least that’s how the sign post describes it.</p>

Historic Inn on the Festival Grounds

</div>

<p>The tavern is filled with drunken revelers enjoying their evening. The bartender is a young woman, blonde with a red bandanna over in her hair. She’s pouring some of what must be the house wine for one customer while arguing with another rowdy one. As you approach her for a room key, she gives you a quick smile and turns back to her argument.</p>

<p>“You’re drunk Tal, I’m not serving you any more.” she says with a roll of her eyes. She finishes off the wine bottle to half fill the glass in front of her.</p>

<p>“Seee…Serraaaaa! Iiii’mmmm finu!” the drunk insists jovially. “Du…n… be akull jaooy.”</p>

<p>“Yes Tal, I’m a killjoy, it’s in the job description. Go home.” She says with a wry grin and an aside look. She uncorks a new bottle and resumes pouring.</p>

<p>“AH’lllll Ha-ta buring ya sem jaooy den!” the drunk slurs and he reaches over the bar with a lecherous look on his face.</p>

<p>He quickly finds a bottle slammed onto his hand, Serra rolling her eyes again. As he cradles his hand in his chest, she leans over the bar herself and flicks him in the forehead. The barstool topples over and deposits it’s occupant on the floor, much to the amusement of the bar as a whole.</p>

<p>“Someone drag him home will you?” Serra calls to the room at large as she serves the untouched glass of wine. A few grunts of affirmation come from the crowd and other wave in acknowledgement.</p>

<p>“Now then, off the masks you lot. If you want a room all I’ve got left is one of the ones with a view, and they aren’t cheap tonight. 10 coins gold standard.” Serra says.</p>

<p>Stepping over a man who can’t seem to get to his feet, you head up the stairs to the room inscribed on the key. The room is little more than a bed and desk, simplistic ones at that. There is a door out to one of the ‘proclaimed’ balconies though, and you can see almost half the festival grounds from the vantage point. On the balcony are a handful of chairs for sitting and observing.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2018-01-29</em></p>

<p>After drunkenly mashing some leaves together rather than simply using healing magic, Nokri passes out on part of the bed, using Aldus and Eliran’s conversation as a bedtime story.</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2018-01-29</em></p>

<p>After a short little crisis over his wounds and some less than top notch “care” from Nokri. Aldus and Eliran talk for awhile out on the balcony about the woman Aldus overheard the men referring to earlier. They decide that they will rest, and when they wake they will set out to the festival overlook - where they mentioned to be keeping her.</p>

<p>After their talk Aldus lies back in bed next to Nokri. It feels awkward but he really needs quality  rest and so he elects to ignore it. <em>At least she’s facing the other way</em> he thinks to himself. It takes him awhile to get to sleep that night due to not only the awkwardness of sharing the room with two virtual strangers, but also the discomfort of strange plant matter now dried and caked to his stomach. In his half asleep state his mind begins to wander to the last time he shared a bed with someone, how comfortable it was, how perfect everything seemed back then - the memory is quickly interrupted by pain in his chest that quickly drops to his stomach. The pain is not from any bruise or wound this time though. Aldus lets out small groan - almost a whimper. He decides counting deer in his head is probably a better way of falling asleep instead.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-01-29</em></p>

<p>Eliran follows Aldus in, and bids the laguz good night. As Aldus gets all set for bed, Eliran instead grabs his lute and whats left of Nokri’s drink and heads outside, closing the balcony door behind him. Taking a sip, he recoils slightly, <em>what did she put in this thing?</em> he wonders as he takes his seat again. Since it was still relatively early in the evening, he took some time to play softly on his lute and practice a slow lullaby.</p>

<p>As he hums into the night, Eliran considers the days events, wondering when the last time he had joined a party was. <em>Maybe it would be nice to take a journey again</em> He thought to himself, <em>the laguz seems nice enough.</em></p>

<p>As the night got later and later, Eliran brought one of the outdoor chairs into the room. Forming a pillow out of some clothes, he laid back in the chair, slowly falling into slumber.</p>
