            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-01-25</em></p>

<p>Ransford gives a last few orders to his men and nods with his head in the direction the exit of the room. He leads the way, sword and shield still drawn and at the ready. He, unlike his men, ignores a few doors and heads straight for the end of the hall, stopping at a large pair of double doors.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis looks promising.‚Äù he mutters. He looks to each of you, nods, then pushes the door open with his shield in front of him.</p>

<p>(ooc: returning from table-5)</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2018-01-26</em></p>

<p>Elfriede sat back down on the bed and pondered over the fight again. They had to become stronger if Rica was able to do what she did to them. Training together sounded like a good idea. Atalantia was strong and Afina brilliant. Himself swift and cunning but if they didnt learn how to work together‚Ä¶</p>

<hr />

<p>The knight lieutenant left briefly to secure hand washing materials that they usually have on hand in these barracks and a bucket of water. He sat at the end of the low bed, removed his shirt and began grating it against the board in the water. He wanted it clean before attempting any repairs on it, secretly hoping one of his companions was proficient in sewing.</p>

<p>He glanced over to his companions. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wash whatever you two need, just throw it in the water. Sorry in advance, I probably won‚Äôt be able to get it all out, but it‚Äôll have to do for now.‚Äù</p>

<p>Elfriede freezes in place as it finally hits him. He was so caught up in the moment he hadn‚Äôt realized. <em>Someone knows‚Ä¶</em>. <em>Someone</em> had undressed him.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2018-01-27</em></p>

<p>Afina used a bathroom to freshen up and change into another outfit. Being a regal dress, with little to no functionality, she tried to wear it only when lounging around Tyndall Tower. Now, however, with her travelling clothes in a state of disrepair, this was her only option. The princess strode through the halls of the outpost with her shoulders back and head held high, a spell book tucked underneath her arm. Among the gritty and tough soldiers, Afina seemed very out of place. The fabric of her long, blue dress fluttering as she walked, standing in stark contrast to the ranks of armor-clad men that patrolled the station. But such a fact had no bearing on Afina. Filled with energy and competitive spirit, Afina was determined to master her magic.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<p>As Elfriede sat down to wash their clothes, Afina was finishing a letter to her father in Callora. She wrote hesitantly, thoughtfully, pouring over every word as she scrawled it on the paper.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Dearest Father, 
I hope this letter finds you well. By now, word must have reached you that I am travelling to Eraia to study abroad. Master Witella was able to secure passage and paperwork to travel to Trisp, and while I am not formally studying among other light mages, I hope that the cultural immersion will assist me in my pursuit of knowledge. How does Laera find itself now? Is the King‚Äôs Council serving you well?
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Though we have only been travelling but a day‚Äôs time, my escorting party has already engaged in a skirmish with violent laguz near an Eraian military outpost. We fought valiantly, and I am proud to say we brought many laguz to rightful justice as a result. I would like to think that every laguz captured today brings us one step closer to righting the wrongdoings done to our people.

The travelling party is light, but formidable. I am escorted to Trisp by an Eraian knight, Elfriede Faun, and a Wynne laguz-noble, Atalantia Enneka. 

Elfriede is a skilled swordsman with a rapier, with a very admirable dedication to honor and duty. I trust him to carry out his current order of escorting our party to Trisp safely, and I hope to speak with him more on his experiences as an Eraian noble. Were he not as such, I believe you would find him quite palatable for your own guard.

Atalantia hails from the tribal lands of the north, and as such, has quite deadly mastery of her two swords. Her strong sense of justice is venerable, though I cannot concede I entirely agree with her views. Her customs are foreign to me, but as the leader of our party, I strive to understand them. Perhaps this is something that will come with time. 

Elfriede has generously offered his residence in the event that a courier need make a delivery on our venture. I humbly request a further shipment of clothes and books, the titles of which you will find below. 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Afina pondered for a moment whether to write that she missed her parents and country, but decided against it after some thought. ‚ÄúWishing you love and knowledge always‚Äù she wrote, signing a curvy, neat ‚ÄúAfina‚Äù underneath it. She stood, brushing the wrinkles off her dress and placing the letter on the desk.</p>

<p>Walking over to Elfriede, she pinned her family crest to her dress, before handing the knight her battle-worn garments. ‚ÄúYour help is most appreciated,‚Äù she said, stooping low to pick up the damp clothing, and laying it out on a nearby bench to dry. ‚ÄúShould you need a seamstress, I will be happy to provide in turn once the garments are dry,‚Äù Afina nods to her company, sitting back at the desk to continue her spell studies, small flickers of light radiating from the desk with each practiced spell.</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2018-01-28</em></p>

<p>Atalantia stands awkwardly, grasping one of her arms, in Elfriede‚Äôs long and comforting shirt. Until this moment she truly forgot that her old clothes were torn, which saddened her slightly. Her clothes were a symbol of her pride and leadership in her Uinpeng tribe. Without them, she felt a bit lost.</p>

<p>She then glances outside the medical room‚Äôs window once more in order to further grasp on to reality. Just a few hours ago she wasn‚Äôt sure if she would be able to survive. But now she has been given a chance to further grow as a warrior with her new friends.</p>

<hr />
<p>Atalantia then acknowledges her friends once more, and escorts herself outside the medical room making sure to take her dual blades with her.  If Atalantia was going to protect her friends, she had to get even stronger, and the only way to do that is to continue training. Atalantia then begins to practice some forms and techniques with her blades outside the military building.</p>
