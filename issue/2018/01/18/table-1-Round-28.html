            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-01-18</em></p>

<p>Orar looks over the two masked salesman slowly. His eyes narrow at the one in the fox mask. Despite the noise and bustle of the festival his silence is noticeable and it seems to go on for hours. Orar looks behind the two of them to the girl behind the counter and his brow furrows.</p>

<p>“Orar?” Lac says, having stepped up next to the man. “You aren’t shopping right now are you?” Orar only responds with another raised hand as he looks from masked face to masked face. Lac taps his foot before scoffing.</p>

<p>“I’m not waiting around Orar. They’re getting further away the longer we stand here. If you stare long enough maybe you can convince yourself that fox” Lac points with a thumb at Eliran, “is the rat.” Lac says as he turns on his heel and starts off towards the circle of dancers and onlookers. He points his men in various directions and the assembled people scatter the festival in smaller groups.</p>

<p>Orar takes one last look at the wolf masked salesman before he grunts out a “Thanks.” and stalks off.</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2018-01-22</em></p>

<p>Aldus let’s out a releived sigh as soon as the two are far enough away, and visibly relaxes. Electing to leave the mask on for now, he turns to the other two. “I’d say we should be on way to the inn before the actual owner of this stall returns…. or worse” he says leaving a few coins on the counter in exchange for the mask.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2018-01-22</em></p>

<p>“Mmhmm.” Nokri doesn’t bother to pick up the coins Aldus left, but she does take the few she made from mask sales. She considered it payment for her five or so minutes of labor.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-01-22</em></p>

<p>“It was a good performance” Eliran didn’t touch the coins that Aldus left, nor did he add to the pile. Instead, he flipped his fox mask with that of a coyote. “This way” he said, continuing to lead the two, making sure to avoid the direction Orar and Lac went specifically while still heading towards the inn. 
As he lead the way, Eliran thought back to the two men’s conversation, worried about the woman who was the object of their boss’ desires. <em>you can’t get there two any more involved in your problems. Take care of them first</em> He thought, glancing back towards Aldus and Nokri</p>
