            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-01-11</em></p>

<p>The stall keepers wave to you and the dancers try to invite you in but you walk past them and they don’t press you. Soon only the row of tents stands between you and the Inn, yet it never seems to be that easy. You can see walking with purpose through the crowd behind you and the row ahead of you more men dressed like those who’ve been following you all this time. At the back you see Lac, and the front you see Orar, and to your sides are massive tent flaps. It’s not an easy spot to be in, though there’s a slight corner in the connecting tents on the right that you duck into for at least a moment’s worth of cover. There’s a flap that leads into one of the tents, the tent the big top for a circus, three rings adorning the floor of the tent and stands all around the outside. The corner is formed by the connecting tunnel to other tent. Some circus personnel mill about inside.</p>

<p>(ooc: There are many ways around a problem outside of conflict. Your group is decidedly better at them that light cannon, i like swords, and sir trips alot so have at thee. I’ve set the parts of the scene that are important, the tent, the dancers, the stalls, and the inn beyond the circus. You have the freedom to move about in them and explore so have it. You can use asides for in character planning and #occ to discuss, this is a collaborative story so collaborate.)</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-01-15</em></p>

<p><em>shit</em> Looking around Eliran found the answer to their new problem. Seeing a nearby unattended stall with festival masks, he knew what they had to do. 
“I’ve got an idea,” he said, quickly grabbing three masks and passing two to Nokri and Aldus “quick put these on.”</p>

<p><del>Eliran then proceeded to take a massive shit on the whole city</del></p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2018-01-15</em></p>

<p><em>What moron just leaves their stall unattended?</em> Nokri grudgingly took the mask handed to her, only realizing what it was for when she looked up. Rolling her eyes, she strolled over to the empty mask store and said to her companions “I recommend you two get over here, now.” There was probably enough empty storage space where they could hide without being kicked <em>too</em> much.</p>

<p>The neighboring shopkeeps were luckily busy with customers for the moment, but they’d surely be confused when they noticed the mask seller suddenly transformed into someone else. Nokri lackadaisically put on the ridiculous smiling mask, wishing the thugs would pass by and this would all be over soon. Head still pounding, she undid her braids in hopes it would simultaneously ease the headache and make recognition more difficult. Instead, the wavy hair just blew about in the wind and obscured her vision more than the mask did, getting into her eyes. <em>I’m too fed up to deal with this right now.</em></p>

<p>There was a heavy cash box Nokri eyed up behind the table, but it was solidly locked, and trying to unlock it now would just cause more unwarranted attention. “Tch.”</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2018-01-15</em></p>

<p>Adus inhales sharply as he spots Lac and Orar closing in on them. A few half baked escape plans run through his head but before he can fully form an idea Eliran pulls him and Nokri into an unoccupied mask vendors stall. Aldus takes the masks thrust into his hands and turns it over to look at the front, the face of a wolf stares back at - <em>ha how ironic</em> he thinks dryly.</p>

<p>Nokri instructs him to hide underneath the stall. “Why should I hide underneath the stall, and wear a mask” he says, donning the mask and pulling up his hood, making sure to tuck his easily notable gray-white hair underneath. “I think I have a better idea” he says grabbing a stray apron from a storage box and putting it on, he walks around to the outside of the stall. Joining the din of other festival vendors he begins calling out to passerbys trying to sell them his newly acquired wares. “Masks! Get masks here! Join the festivities! Become whoever you want!”</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-01-15</em></p>

<p>Eliran grins underneath his fox mask, also notices the heavy cash box, <em>I could probably get that</em> he thought to himself casually, not really with any  intention to steal, but more a self-assestment and appreciation for his own skills. Seeing Aldus’s actions, he joins in calling people to the booth to buy the items.</p>
