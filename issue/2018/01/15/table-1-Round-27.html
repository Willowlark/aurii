            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2018-01-15</em></p>

<p>Lac and Orar’s groups come to meet not a stall over from you. The veritable horde of men block the path way for the rest of the fair goers with their numbers milling about. You can hear the two men discussing.</p>

<p>“Damnit. I thought I saw a dog over here.” Lac says with an angry click of his tongue. Orar nods in response, head on a swivel looking over the festival area. “Boss isn’t going to be happy we lost the guy.” Lac continues. “Think having that woman will keep our heads from rolling?”</p>

<p>“Boss can deal with her himself, their already at the festival overlook. We just do our job.” Orar finally replies. His gaze lingers on the wolf masked salesman a stall over. Lac starts saying something else but is quieted by a raised hand from Orar. Orar walks up to the mask stall.</p>

<p>“Excuse me. Have you sold any of those masks to a young trio?” He asks in a polite voice but doesn’t both putting on a smile. “A wolf laguz boy, likely carrying a short girl of Drecian descent, and a second boy with a minstrel’s lute? They’d be about your age.” Lac looks on from the center of the area with a half interested expression.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2018-01-17</em></p>

<p>These idiots. They were going to get them discovered  faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August, shouting in the middle of the street like that. Nokri would have liked to sink under the table herself, but unfortunately they started attracting customers. Very unwanted customers.</p>

<p>She watched from the jagged, mostly obscured corner of her eye, hoping they wouldn’t mess this up. Meanwhile, any customers that approached her would be told the masks were a random, evenly numbered price in the hopes they’d pay up and Nokri could pocket the profits.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-01-17</em></p>

<p>Eliran paused after hearing the inquiry, as if he was honestly considering it, “I don’t recall seeing a wolf laguz, but….” he scratched the side of his head, “There <em>was</em> a young minstral here not to long ago that bought three masks.” he offered. Eliran hoped this ploy would work better than the last, and that by the end of it he could send the thugs the wrong the direction.</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2018-01-17</em></p>

<p>He swallows hard as Lac and Orar walk into the area, he can just make out what they’re saying as they near them.</p>

<p>“Think having that woman will keep our heads from rolling?” he hears the one who royally messed him up say, his rib twinges at the memory <em>What woman? Who could they be talking about?</em>  He’ll have to see if Eliran can give him any insight into that later.</p>

<p>For a minute he thinks the two brutes will pass their stall by without a second glance, as they’ve done with the others they have passed. It appears they will have no such luck.  Eliran speaks before Aluds has a chance to react to the large man’s question, giving him a moment to steal himself.</p>

<p>He takes a breath, and says in an upbeat tone “Ah yes, quite the garish fellow that one. Couldn’t forget him if I tried. Seemed to be in a rush, I believe he went off that way”. Aldus points off in a direction that is neither where they came from nor where they are going.</p>
