<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Location: Theanovene Observatory, NW district
Characters: Aldus, Nokri
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You make good time through the streets, be it because of Nokri’s ability to navigate the crowds or Aldus clearing a path for the small girl. Cutting through the Observatory park also saved you a fair bit of strife, the park mostly empty asides from older people feeding the birds and so on. The parks exits borders the Theanovene observatory on the north side, a pleasant offering to bring some green to the sprawling city of Theanovene. There isn’t much in the way of trees in the park, but the flowers and manicured green grass do the job.</p>

<p>Passing out of the north gate the Observatory is to your left. The core of the building is a upside down bowl shape, with a large telescope peering through the top. Half the dome’s roof is missing, allowing the telescope to move but making poor weather a terrible problem. Connected the building, in the far corners from you, are two short towers with a connecting bridge between their upper floors. They rise to just below the telescope’s height, as to not block the view from the device. Lights shine from these windows even at this time of day, assuredly hard working scholars in their studies. You can see the large oak doors in the center of the dome as you reach the middle of the courtyard.</p>

<p>Beyond the observatory, there is a large courtyard in front of you. The maze of buildings doesn’t resume for another 50 yards in the northern and eastern directions. The cobblestone was laid in such a way that, if one were to look down on the courtyard from on high, a concave lens shape would appear.</p>

<p>From an eastern street a group of Drecian soldiers enter the courtyard. One kicks over a pot planter and growls something to his friends, which they vocally agree with. From what Aldus’s lupine ears can pick up, they’re rather upset about their treatment by the locals. They fan out slightly, enjoying the wide open courtyard rather than the dense Theanovene street.</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-11-13</em></p>

<p>“Shit” Aldus says under his breath as he sees the Drecians moving into to their left across the courtyard. He was hoping he wouldn’t have to see any more of these people for a while, no such luck it would seem.</p>

<p>He grabs Norki’s hand and starts guiding her toward the observatory while trying to be discreet about it, he doesn’t want to make it too obvious he’s trying to avoid the Drecians. He tugs her closer to him trying to make the two of them appear as a couple to onlookers, and whispers “play along and if this goes south - we run”</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2017-11-13</em></p>

<p>Nokri perused Aldus’s map with a blank face, studying the area and connecting what she saw on the paper to what she knew of the city and its surroundings.  She merely nodded along with what he was saying, flatly agreeing that they should avoid warzones. “Also. The less we stick out, the better. I can camp, that won’t be an issue, unless bandits.”  After a few moments she added “this plan sounds better than any. May as well, we can adjust what we do as we do it to best suit the situation.”</p>

<p>Her mind was still on the map and their journey ahead as they walked into the courtyard. The sound of broken pottery in the distance caught her attention, and some loud voices though she couldn’t make out what they were. “Hey. D’you th-“</p>

<p>Before finishing her sentence, Aldus had already sprung into action and they were moving in a new direction. It made sense what he was doing, but Nokri was not happy about it. She resisted wrinkling her nose and pushing him away, and instead tried to play along. She tugged the bandana on her hair back so it would cover up the blonde color and briskly tucked what she could of her braids into the back of her shirt. The smile she donned at first was terrifying and worthy of haunting children’s nightmares, but would adjust to a proper smile once she focused more, acting kind and innocent like she did at her shop. “They probably aren’t cultured enough to follow us in here, hmm?” she asked quietly as they came close to the observatory.</p>
