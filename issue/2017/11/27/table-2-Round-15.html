            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-11-27</em></p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, uh. Do‚Ä¶ you mind Anneke? the man says over his shoulder.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot at all. We don‚Äôt get many house guests out this way, with the whole local bandit tribe thing. We‚Äôd be happy to give you a place to sleep.‚Äù she says.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, you heard her. Come on in.‚Äù he says, stepping to the right. ‚ÄúMy name is Rudi, by the way‚Ä¶‚Äù he says.</p>

<p>Entering the cabin you can see it‚Äôs just as scarcely decorated on the near walls as the far ones. There‚Äôs no more furniture or furnishings, aside from a few more chairs on the near wall, that you saw before. There is however, a pair of muscular tiger Kissaelain that dive from behind the door and grab the two ‚Äòguests‚Äô from behind as Rudi closes the door. Knives florish to your necks as the beastman make it clear they‚Äôd rather you not try to escape.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶ most people knock on the door Rudi?‚Äù Anneke asks as she pulls her own knife out.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNever. Don‚Äôt let her draw those blades Archaim. This is strange. Who are you, and what are you doing out here?‚Äù Rudi says, walking around to face the two.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2017-11-27</em></p>

<p>Afina took a deep breath, opening her mouth  to conjure the spell. She froze for a second, remembering that K and Atalantia would have no warning when the blinding light appeared. Biting her lip, she tried to think of some way to warn them. Tapping the glass? Too obvious. Yelling? That would put HER in danger. She needed to cast the spell safely from outside while still giving adequate warning and‚Äì</p>

<p>She looked down at the book, at the letters and symbols, thinking how they were the conduit for her magical ability. Each tome had a few copies of each spell. This idea was far-fetched, but it might just work‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Taking hold of the page, she ripped it out and crumpled it up in her hands. Afina glanced up at the window, and carefully lifted it ever so slightly ajar. She wished luck to herself quickly, before tossing the small paper ball into the middle of the room.</p>

<p>Afina ducked down, hiding again beneath the window sill, and hurriedly started reciting from her second copy of the spell. Her hand shook as she traced the words with her finger, and her quick recitation was scarcely louder than a hushed whisper. Inside, among the confusion, the small paper ball began to shimmer faintly, as did the book in her hands. Afina heard the muffled noise of a few panicked words exchanged, before the inside of the cabin erupted with a brilliant light. Even without facing the cabin, she could tell from the light that shone through the windows that it‚Äôs brightness was intense. She hoped her company had recognized the warning and covered their eyes.</p>

<p>The light abruptly faded as Afina stopped reciting, almost as if a switch had been flipped, and inside she could hear the scuffling and noise inside. She nodded at Elfriede. The other half of the plan was mostly up to him.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2017-11-28</em></p>

<p>Elfriede let out a loud chuckle at Afina‚Äôs ridiculous decision, but the fact that it worked was even more ludicrous! Elfriede braced himself and forced the door inward breaking the very frail hinges.</p>

<p>He emerged to a scene of 2 allies be held against their will (albeit loosely now that they were staggered). Elfriede sneered at the 4 present in the room, the two larger tiger ones that were holding onto the allies had to be dealt with first. Kailyn needed to be freed to cast her spells and Atalantia was strong enough to muscle her way out.</p>

<p><em>First priority.</em></p>

<p>Elfriede lunged to the left, slicing at the knife-holding wrist with his dagger landing a solid hit, then ducking low to stab at the ankle of the large tiger lagu. The dagger fell helplessly to the ground at the same moment the tip of the rapier penetrated the ankle of the foe.</p>

<p>The boy had clearly under-estimated his large opponent. Although injured and clearly blinded, the lagu shoulder checked Elfriede. Hard. He went flying back into the door frame and hit against it flat up against his back. Pain shot up his side and his back as both his tail crunched under the hit and shoulder briefly dislocated causing him to drop his primary sword. He winced through tear beads, but still managed to roll when he touched down and slashed hard at the lagus hamstring with his remaining dagger.</p>

<p>Elfriede glanced up to K hoping that she had regained herself enough to assist.</p>
