            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-11-27</em></p>

<p>The old man says nothing for a time, looking deeply into his tea.</p>

<p>“That is quite the tale, clipped as it may be. I would not press you for details on such a trying event, of course.” he says with watching the legs of his tea slip down the sides of the cup. “Indulge an old man a story, for I know you will appreciate it the way I do.”</p>

<p>“I’m no astronomer, though it may be obvious. My title is that of Grand Sage, which if you are unfamiliar with the ranks spell casters use is at the top of the list.” He looks up at you with a soft wink. “I find all the pomp and circumstance about it to be utter poppycock.”</p>

<p>“I tell you this, because my rank denotes that I take on apprentices. I’ve had quite the few through the years and they are like sons or daughters to me. But…” his eyes drop to his tea again. “My last apprentice was swayed by that brute Dryn Wulfa. I know not how, nor even why, but the foolish boy now serves that warlord directly. Anis is a natural with Anima magic, I can see why they want him. I already recognize his work affecting the war front.” Osbury sighs.</p>

<p>“It sounds terrible, I know. But I know the boy. He’s logical to a fault. No matter who came to him with the argument, if it was sound logic he’d listen. I know Dryn and his men tricked Anis somehow. And now Anis is in Dreca, away from anyone who can open his foolish eyes.” the old man finishes his tea and stands, walking around behind your chairs.</p>

<p>“Of course, this matters not to you two. I have merely held this story in far too long. I too, have lost something to Dreca. I too, have reason to bar the door at those soldier’s approach.” he pauses for a moment. “Soldiers which have thankfully, left my courtyard.” He comes back around to face you again.</p>

<p>“I shall hold you no longer, as was the agreement. Thank you for listening to my story so intently. I do ask, if you ever met someone else who feels the same way about Dreca as you and I, who might be able to reach Anis… Direct them to me. He is like a son to me; I see no better use for my resources as Grand Sage than to direct them to knocking some sense into the fool.” Osbury smiles.</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-11-29</em></p>

<p>Aldus’s eyes open wide as Nokri tells her story, he feels tea dribble down his stubbled chin in surprise at her story and has to catch it with a napkin - so much for table manners. He’s unsure whether her story is true or not but either way Osbury seems satisfied with it. Aldus pops a biscuit in his mouth as the man tells his own tale. They have a sweet citrus flavor and he has to stop himself from shoving a few in his pouch for the road.</p>

<p>Listening to the old man’s take only cements the bad impression Dreca is making oin Aldus. Being from a reasonably secluded nation he has never encountered anyone from the war hungry country he’s only heard rumors about, but it seems they live up to their reputation. He rises from his chair, anxious to be on the road again and away from all this.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear about your apprentice, sir. I hope that one day he sees the light and returns home to you” He says pushing his chair back in place “Thank you for the tea and biscuits - they were quite delicious!” He gives a toothy smile to the man before turning to Nokri and pointing to the door with his thumb “Shall we?”</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2017-11-30</em></p>

<p>The old man’s story sent a shiver down Nokri’s spine. Grand Sage? A top of the list spell caster? The horrid urge that drove Nokri to leave as soon as humanly possible began to dissipate and her interest in the old man exploded.  She recalled how she had been acting from the moment they walked in through the door until now. Did she do anything uncouth? Was she rude in any way? She couldn’t recall anything horrendously offensive.</p>

<p>She wiped the crocodile tears from her eyes and straightened her slouch. In her peripheral vision she saw Aldus had crumbs and tea on his face. <em>That slob! Did he not hear whose presence we’re in right now?</em> Granted, she didn’t even know the position of Great Sage existed until just moments prior. But she sure knew now and it sure sounded impressive, so she sure wasn’t going to do anything to get in his bad graces.</p>

<p>“What a horrible tale. I pray that your apprentice sees the error of his ways soon, and that he may return to walk beside us on the path of light once more.” Nokri was intent to fully embrace her hackneyed backstory and get on this old codger’s good side.</p>

<p>“Aldus, is the path truly clear? Should we not stay here until we’re absolutely certain?” She peered out the window, not really caring what she saw but feigning to search. “Good sir, thank you ever so much for your hospitality. We are graciously in your debt,” she said with a slight bow.  “I feel as though a weight has been lifted off my chest thanks to you.”</p>
