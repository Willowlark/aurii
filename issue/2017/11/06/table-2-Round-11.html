            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-11-06</em></p>

<p>Kailyn is witness to an amazing site as she approaches the shack. As the slight incline levels off she can see that the shack is backed by the edge of a cliff. Below the massive trees of the forest continue, yet the tops don’t rise above the cliff. It gives off a distinct feeling of flying. The view is made all the more impressive by the sun sinking behind the trees beyond the cliff face, tinting the world an autumnal color.</p>

<p>The shack itself is as nondescript as before. To be frank, it comes off as an eyesore to this glorious view. The boards of the house are in fact made from the same type of tree, weakening the contrast of the house. If not for the brass doorknob on the front door it’d be hard to differentiate the door from the wall. There are no windows on the front side of the shack.</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2017-11-07</em></p>

<p>Atalantia notices K walking ahead of the party in hopes to lure the bandits out of their hideout so that the party could surprise attack. Noticing this, Atalantia knew she had to stop K; such an act by K would go against Atalantia’s desire to enter the situation diplomatically. The entire party seemed to rush into the conclusion that this <em>hideout</em> belonged to the bandits, even though it could belong to completely innocent and unrelated people. And even if they are the bandits, entering through a front door without any real plan would surely pose a danger to the party (and it is very crucial to protect Afina so that Elfriede’s mission is fulfilled, K can learn magic, and Atalantia can form an alliance).</p>

<p>Atalantia hurries towards K, and proceeds to grab her wrists so that she can turn K to face her.
 “Slow down there K! I think it would be best to analyze this situation and not go in for the surprise attack. The nobles seem to hold  harsh judgements against our Laguz people. If we were to make the assumption that the people who live in this <em>hideout</em>  are in fact the  laguz bandits who wish to cause harm, wouldn’t we be no different from the nobles? If we wish to end the discrimination against our people we must prove our worth and that we can handle situations diplomatically. Otherwise it’ll be easy for others to consider are actions to be animalistic, or at the very least it’ll make it easy for the others to blame anything that goes wrong on us.” <em>Atalantia then looks K in the eyes and waits for a response</em></p>

<p>Atalantia then looks towards the party, “As I said before, I think we should hold off on using weapons for now. We must examine the situation and choose our strategy wisely. We would not want to harm the innocent nor endager ourselves.”</p>

<p><strong>Kailyn (John B)</strong> - <em>2017-11-09</em></p>

<p>Kailyn simply smiles at Atalantia’s response. Atalantia doesn’t know her plan, which makes sense due to the small fact that she kept it to herself. In response, she grabs Atalantia by the shoulder, moving back to the party and giving a brief rundown of her plan.</p>

<p>“Relax Atalantia.” Kailyn states, “My plan isn’t to harm, only to have us apprehend them if they have committed the crimes they’ve been accused of. I have dealt with many types of villains and swindlers over the years, and none have ever gotten past my eyes.”</p>

<p>She looks back at the rest of the party. “My plan is to simply lure them, have them come out in fewer numbers and if possible, solve this peacefully. But a group to a criminal is always a problem. If I may, I would like to deal with them alone. Try to listen in and keep stealth as your friend.”</p>

<p>“Do we all comply?”</p>
