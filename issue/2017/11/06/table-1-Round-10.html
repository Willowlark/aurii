            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-11-06</em></p>

<p>(ooc: I’ve got nothing for you guys, keep on doing what you’re doing.)</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2017-11-08</em></p>

<p>Nokri locked the door while leaving merely out of habit. Within days it’d likely get broken into and in a matter of weeks the landlord would resell it without her there. There still wasn’t anyone around outside, but who knew who was watching from a window? “Alright… Albus, was it? Lets get a move on.” Nokri knew the path to the outside of town but barely anything past that. If it wasn’t marked on a roadside sign she would just wander wherever until arriving at some form of civilization. She opened her mouth as they neared Theanovene’s border. “Before we leave, do you know how to get to this place?”</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-11-08</em></p>

<p>“Aldus, actually” he says matter-of-factly, following her down the street in front her small apartment.</p>

<p>On their way out of town it becomes apparent to Aldus that he’s going to be playing navigator, and protector here. “Well, I have map” He says pulling a folded, and rolled up piece of parchment from a tube on his belt. He opens the map and holds it out, giving one end to her to hold up. “So I thought about that a little more while you were getting your things- I figured you’d probably want to stay away from any potential war zones as much as possible. So I suggest hugging the mountains through Calora instead - There doesn’t seem to be any large villages or cities marked here so mostly just make camp along the way.” He runs his finger across the parchment drawing a trail around the mountains ”Shortly into Eraia there appears to be a small town to the west. Maybe stop there and see if we can find some direction on where to start the search? I admittedly haven’t thought much further than that” He says shrugging “I’m kind of making this up as I go along”</p>
