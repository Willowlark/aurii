            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-11-02</em></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Location: Deep in the Woods
Characters: Afina, Atalania, Kailyn, Elfreide
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Not even an hour passes before the path into the woods Ransford told you of reveals itself. Were the group not warned about it would easily pass as no more than a hiking trail. For the first hour of the walk the path feels like one as well, no skulls hanging from crosses or bodies strung up in the trees. The path is anything but straight; between that and the tree’s blocking most of the sky you’ll need a compass to know which end is up, let alone north.</p>

<p>After that hour of winding this way and that, you start to notice signs of people, despite how deep into the woods you are. Cut marks on the trees, boot prints in the dirt, and other clues. The foliage seems fuller this far in as well, blocking the sun’s rays as it begins it’s downward descent. Yet as you turn another bend you can see your goal as plan as day.</p>

<p>No more than 300 feet away you can see a small wooden building, made almost entirely of planks and not exactly well built. It’s a quirky building, as it’s all the same color wood and that makes it look fake or maybe even unnatural. The tree line even seems to shy away from the building, ending a good 30 feet before the building itself. Behind the building you can see the tops of trees and the sun as it starts to set.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2017-11-02</em></p>

<p><em>Elfriede’s hands move to his weapon hilts and he glances at Atalantia</em></p>

<p>“At least take your hands off her…” <em>Elfriede grimaces</em></p>

<p>“You’ve spoken your mind, now lets continue.”</p>

<hr />
<p>(arriving at the site of the building)</p>

<p>“Hmm, I’m for thinking that there is some deception afoot here. Definitely be ready for anything as we approach the building. Situations like these they might have someone that looks meek distract you while the rest of the group flanks.” <em>Elfriede whispers to the group</em></p>

<p><em>His hands drift again to his weapon hilts which he quietly draws; Rapier in his right hand and parrying dagger with curved hilt wrist guards for catching enemy swords and turning them away</em></p>

<p>“Although I’m no assassin, sneaking up may not be an option.”</p>

<p><em>Elfriede readies his weapons and goes to begin his slow approach to the building</em></p>

<p><strong>Afina (Georgia🍀 )</strong> - <em>2017-11-02</em></p>

<p>Afina frowns at Atalantia, brows knit. “Forgive me, though I know your matters are urgent to address, I am currently occupied with sorting out my own thoughts. It’s very jarring to have been admonished for doing the right thing, a thing of which I did not even want to engage in to begin with.”</p>

<p>She clears her throat, turning her gaze to make eye contact with Atalantia. “Furthermore, know that I don’t make empty assertions that I’m the leader. I am the entity that unites us in one cause, am I not?” She points at each party member in turn. “Elfriede’s escort mission? Your quest for a symbol of alliance? K’s search for knowledge? Was it not my door you knocked on? Therefore, if I am the entity that brings us all together, then, shouldn’t it be true that I represent the interests of my party the best, with fairness and consideration to all?” By then, each member of their travelling company was listening to Afina in some capacity or another. This was no longer a conversation between the two girls.</p>

<p>“Elfriede and I have a duty to uphold; he to serve his kingdom, and I to serve mine. And to shirk our responsibilities for a detour we could live without taking… “ Afina shakes her head. “Of course you want to extinguish the laguz that give your race a bad name. I don’t understand it, and as a human probably never will. And yet, as a leader, I ruled that we would travel together to defeat these bandits as it were. Not because I want to, and not because it serves any purpose for me. But because it is just and fair to do so. And I don’t feel like this sacrifice of personal preference over “fairness” was appreciated very much. Which… is natural for a noble leader, of course. No one thanks you when that’s your position. So I shouldn’t expect any less.”</p>

<p>Taking out a book, Afina begins to thumb through it, as a signal that the conversation is clearly over, at least for the moment. “I also don’t appreciate being touched as such,” she adds with a frown, hand hovering over the side of her face. “Nobles exchange pleasantries, not physicalities.”</p>

<p>With a tap on the shoulder, Afina turns to K, closing her book for the moment. The softer words of her cat laguz companion are a more familiar tone of voice. Her father’s consol spoke to their king with a similar imploring and open tone. Afina even manages a smile. “I’m not afraid to trust you. Believe me. Laerans see discrimination as a form of ignorance, after all.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Afina marched along the path with her book open, intently studying the pages. She had long lost track of where they were by now, trusting her more keen companions to have a better idea than herself. Mumbling to herself and her fingers tracing the pages, her book glowed with a golden light. A waste of spell paper, sure, but there were many more books where this one came from. Burning up one page meant there were still hundreds to be used. The golden hue of the setting sun masked the golden light from her own book, but nonetheless, it shone brilliantly. She halts abruptly, slamming the book shut, as Elfriede addresses their party.</p>

<p>“A bandit hideout? Really? This has more the appearance of a vacation home, if that.” she says, squinting at the house. “I concur though, truly something we should approach with caution.” Afina turns the pages of her book, fingers landing on a defensive light magic spell. Should the situation become dire, Afina had a small dagger in a sheath at the small of her back. The Tyndalls were diplomats first, but they understood the value of a good contingency plan. “Do we just… sneak in?”</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2017-11-06</em></p>

<p>(ooc: tldr since we should have had an aside before this but I got busy with life lol) “You may be the entity that we all have in common, but that does not mean you best represent our interests. K’s interest is to learn magic from you, which you have yet to do anything but have her doubt your capability to do so. My interest is to eventually become the ruler of Wynne, which would benefit from a <em>partnership</em> with you, not subordination. And although Elfriede’s interests are a mystery to me other than following his orders, I am at least wise enough to admit that I don’t speak for him. You are being quite stubborn on this point when at least half the party agrees you are not our leader. A leader needs those that will follow her, you are not one such person.” Atalantia says towards Afina.</p>
<hr />

<p>Atalantia transforms back into her wolf form and storms in front of the group howling a travel song the party has never heard before. (ooc: which sounds eerily similar to the chorus of “MF by AWOLNATION”)</p>

<p>Walking ahead of the group, Atalantia stops abruptly once she notices a small wooden cabin in the distance. Rather than preparing her weapons as Afina and Elfriede did, Atalantia wishes to enter the situation diplomatically. She does not want to automatically assume that the people in this cabin are the bandits, or are people who wish to cause harm.</p>

<p>“Ah that’s interesting. If you all can hold off on the weapons for now, I think that’d be for the best. We do not know the nature of these people or if they even are the bandits” Atalantia says to the party.</p>

<p><strong>Kailyn (John B)</strong> - <em>2017-11-06</em></p>

<p>Kailyn becomes more concerned with Afina’s words more and more. She hoped more from this exchange, but instead felt more disdain from the mention of discrimination. Kailyn initially meant her ability as leadership from her previous words, but perhaps Afina now sees a problem with discrimination, or maybe it was a confusion of words. Either way, Kailyn only sees Afina’s growing ignorance in multiple fronts.</p>

<p><em>“Perhaps this was a mistake.” Kailyn thought, “Although I came to learn magic, they journey itself has… turned for the worst. The issues can’t be dropped, but should be discussed with more patience on both fronts. However, if the issue of discrimination continues…”</em></p>

<p>Kailyn fears the worse, unsure of what she should do if things are to go south. She has no tolerance over racism and has only let it partially slide due to her opinions on Afina. Perhaps she should just return to Theanovene and try again, she’ll see as time goes by.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the party marched forward to the hideout, Kailyn begins to think up a plan, giving small glares and snickers as they approach closer. She hears Afina’s and Elfriede’s words, thinking to sneak in first. While she appreciates this plan, Kailyn hasn’t had fun in quite some time.</p>

<p>“Please, if I may.” Kailyn interjects, giving a mischievous grin. “Allow me to go ahead and at least distract the bandits one way or another. If I seem to be in trouble, just sneak in and attack. If not, then attack when the time is right.”</p>

<p>Kailyn then begins to take her steps forward into the compound, shooing the rest of the party to hide as she slowly approaches.
(ooc: I am leaving Kailyn approaching the bandit hideout for next round in case someone wants to try and stop her.)</p>
