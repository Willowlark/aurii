        <h1>Theanovene Almanac Volume 1</h1>
        
        <div  markdown="1">
        
            <p>Welcome to the 47th volume of the Theanovene Almanac. As always, we at the Theanovene Newscrafting Guild strive to bring you all the information we can about the world at large. The information published here is everything a fledging caravaneer may want to know going out into Aurii.</p>

<h1 id="headlines">Headlines</h1>

<h2 id="jewellers-guild-looking-to-make-drecian-contacts-despite-opposition">Jeweller’s Guild looking to make Drecian contacts despite opposition</h2>

<p>Reports have come into our offices that individuals in the Jeweller’s Guild are speaking with Drecian officers about setting up exclusive trade rights with Dreca’s mining operations. Dreca’s mountain range is known to have dozens of different precious gems in abundant supply. Currently Dreca is offloading the gemstones as it’s primary export, but our reports say the Jeweller’s Guild would like to limit that supply. This move is being met with backlash on multiple fronts. Many disapprove of forming closer ties with Dreca given their role in starting the war. Others are wary about the Jeweller’s Guild having that much control over over the supply of precious gems on the mainland.</p>

<h2 id="another-fight-on-neutral-grounds-do-eraia-and-dreca-even-care">Another fight on neutral grounds; do Eraia and Dreca even care?</h2>

<p>Despite Theanovene’s status as neutral ground yet another fight broke out between Eraian and Drecian nationals. This fight has left the Theanovene owned Small Shingles inn with extensive property damages and injured a few Thenovene citizens. Despite attempts to bring those responsible to justice, neither Eraia nor Dreca are coming forward with any names. It leaves Theanovene citizens wondering if either country even care to respect the neutral ground agreement.</p>

<h2 id="elbian-memorial-festival-this-year-celebration-already-being-planned">Elbian Memorial festival this year, celebration already being planned</h2>

<p>The 90th anniversary of the terrible disaster that buried the majority of Elbia under the mountain is fast approaching. Rather than dedicate the day to quiet services and memorials the Elbian Memorial Association has decided to turn the streets of Theanovene into a celebration of Elbian culture and life. While festivals of Elbian culture have been held before none have ever been held on the anniversary of the disaster. The Association is looking for volunteers to assist with the event planning, and promises to make the anniversary a day to remember.</p>

<h2 id="laguz-citizens-blamed-for-caravan-attacks-by-beast-bandits">Laguz citizens blamed for caravan attacks by “Beast Bandits”</h2>

<p>Laguz citizens of Theanovene are being harassed after a third caravan was attacked last week by the so called “Beast Bandits”. These bandits appear to be exclusively Laguz and the Laguz residents of Theanovene are reporting harassment against them; people blaming them for the attacks on the caravans. No evidence exists that these bandits have anything to do with Laguz residing in the city and these actions against fine residents of Theanovene are deplorable in the eyes of this author.</p>

<h2 id="drought-continues-in-eastern-aurii">Drought continues in eastern Aurii</h2>

<p>The eastern mountain range continues to soak up all the rain due to the eastern continent. The land is dry from the eastern mountains to the shoreline. Thankfully this drought doesn’t affect anyone but those exploring the Elbia ruins though it certainly brings some fears to mind that the drought could could spread west to Theanovene.</p>

<h2 id="wynnite-ambassador-travelling-to-etrina">Wynnite ambassador travelling to Etrina</h2>

<p>The Wynnite ambassador Raffin Neve is traveling the country side of the Callorian League on his way to Callora’s capital Etrina. While the purpose of his trip is unknown none of sources from Callora report signs of trouble on the horizon. Political scribes guess that whatever business Raffin is traveling with it will not have a major effect on Theanovene trade with the nations.</p>

<h2 id="theanovene-caravan-caught-between-eraian-and-drecian-war-parties-who-shot-first">Theanovene caravan caught between Eraian and Drecian war parties; Who shot first?</h2>

<p>Remnants of a Theanovene caravan returned home three days ago saying they were attacked by ‘armored soldier in the night’. The caravan was unable to identify any insignia on their attacker’s person. Eraia has decried this attack as a Drecian act of violence against the neutral Theanovene while Dreca has done the same to Eraia. The ‘who shot first’ argument has raged for days now and tensions are rising in Theanovene both by nationals of the two accused countries as well as with Theanovene’s citizens.</p>

<h1 id="classifieds-and-rumor-mill">Classifieds and Rumor Mill</h1>

<h2 id="pirate-activity-increasing-on-eraian-shores">Pirate activity increasing on Eraian shores</h2>

<p>Sources in Eraia report that the military has had to deal extensive pirate activity in the south west seas. Eraia has said nothing of this officially though the Newscrafting Guild absolutely trusts our source. We’ve brought this news to military scholars here and Eraia and they’ve told us at the Guild that the increase is likely due to the war’s continued progress.</p>

<h2 id="the-armorers-guild-looking-for-eraian-trade-secrets">The Armorer’s Guild: Looking for Eraian trade secrets?</h2>

<p>Rumors are swirling about that the armorer’s guild is making efforts at replicating or even copying Eraia’s armor crafting techniques. Long known for their skill at the trade, Eraia refuses to share techniques with Theanovene artisans saying that their technique is “<em>A gift from Lylalel for her soldiers in the world</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="feeding-the-fire-the-infamous-influence-guild">Feeding the fire: The infamous Influence Guild</h2>

<p>They resurface every year and this year is no exception. Rumors of a Guild of dedicated con artist, manipulators and politicians who manipulate the Theanovene Council have resurfaced after the Baker’s Guild leader stepped down last month. No evidence of the ‘Influence Guild’, like always, has been found in Theanovene.</p>
