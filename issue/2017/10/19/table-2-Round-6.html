            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-10-19</em></p>

<p>Itory‚Äôs gaze holds on Afina for a moment after her answer to him. He breaks it with a small bow.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI shall send word at once then Milady.‚Äù he says as he steps out the door, leaving behind the four new companions.</p>

<p>.
..
‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The beds in Tyndall Tower made for easy sleeping that night. One would think people with a reputation for reading in bed like the Tyndall‚Äôs would want a hard, uncomfortable mattress so they won‚Äôt fall asleep while reading. Reality is completely contrary to that, with soft, cloud like beds.</p>

<p>Itory has resupplied each of the traveler‚Äôs rations and packs, saving each of you a trip out to replace the perishables used on your trip here. He insists that it is how a guest should be treated in a royal house and takes no repayment. He does however, mention that Lady Tyndall is very important to both her family and her staff; protecting her should not be taken lightly. While he says so lightly, one look at his eyes make it clear how serious he is. He also notes to each of that they should keep in mind they are traveling with a Princess and must act accordingly.</p>

<p>Itory provides a brand new travel pack for Afina in the morning, loaded with the best money can buy. Amazingly, he‚Äôs managed to keep it light enough that it‚Äôs comfortable even for the library dwelling Afina. While he wishes her the best of luck, he doesn‚Äôt see her off with a smile. Instead he wrings his hands behind his back and his brow is furrowed slightly.</p>

<p>Leaving Theanovene is easy and the trail out of town is well traveled. Soon you begin to approach the border of Eraian controlled territory, made obvious by the guard station built on the road. Over half a dozen military men mill about the station, and the can already see your approach.</p>

<p>(ooc: This round is more of an establishing shot kind of thing. Describe your traveling attire and appearance, monologue your thoughts from the road thus far if you have any to write, or even thoughts about the others in the party. If you wish to expand on your conversation with Itory before leaving the tower, that can be an aside as can any conversation you‚Äôd like to have over dinner or in the late evening. Could even monologue a scene in the tower at night if you wanted to.)</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2017-10-19</em></p>

<p><em>In his room he had been given so generously by Lady Tyndall he undressed into sleepwear carefully taking off each piece of armour. Stopping midway to glace down at his tail. Remnant of his Lagu heritage of which he was‚Ä¶. (ashamed?). He brushed his hand through it massaging out the cramped tissue from being cooped up. He finished changing and got into bed and stared at the ceiling and sighed. Then rolled over and slept well that night despite being lost in his thoughts.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>With the full pack on his back he glanced at Itory. ‚ÄúWere you ever in the military? You sort of give me the vibe of an experienced soldier. Thank you for your assistance today. I promise to Lylalel that I will watch over the Lady diligently, although she seems to also be able to take care of herself.‚Äù
*Elfriede leans inward a bit toward Itory and talks softer</em>
‚ÄúI‚Äôll also be watching the others‚Ä¶pray they try anything.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>He gives Itory a nod and rejoins the readying companions</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>On the road Elfriede was wearing his usual travel gear, Duelist armour emblazened with the Symbol of Eraia with a rapier and dagger at each side. Walking with his usual one hand on the pommel posture.</em></p>

<p>‚ÄúAh.‚Äù, Faun said as they began to approach the guard tower.
‚ÄúThe border guards, we should have no trouble passing through Lady Tyndall, I‚Äôll just have a word with them when we get there.‚Äù
<em>Elfriede glances back at her, nods and smiles.</em>
‚ÄúI might even outrank them all~.‚Äù
<em>Elfriede has a short laugh to himself.</em></p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2017-10-19</em></p>

<p>Afina returned to her quarters early, mentally exhausted from the day. Between the failure of her developing spell, the tedious duties of nobility, and the challenges to her authority, she was fatigued. With a huff, she collapsed face down onto bed. Being a princess was hard. Turning her face to see the window, she stared at the moon. She wondered if the people of Laera had forgotten about her departure by now.</p>
<hr />
<p>Afina stood in her underclothes, hands on her hips, frowning at her dresser. She wondered if she should wear the royal blue of Laera in her travels, or try to remain more conspicuous with a neutral gray ensemble. She settled on a gray, tunic-style dress, with black pants and tan boots. Logistically, the outfit was perfect, but it felt so wrong. She carefully pinned a blue cloak around her shoulders, the family emblem on the pin glistening in the morning sunlight. Spinning and posing in the mirror, Afina felt even more confident about her excursions to Eraia. This trip would finally make her qualified to take her title as inheritor to the throne.</p>

<p>Walking downstairs to meet with her companions in the library, she noted the small details of Tyndall Tower. How the bricks lay, where light filtered in through cracks in the windows, the distinct dryness that allowed for the Tyndalls to preserve so many books. At the foot of the stairs, she encountered Itory, who brandished a new travel pack for her. She gasped, thanking him profusely, before noting her party already gathered in the library. Realizing she was the one everyone was waiting for, she hurriedly thanked Itory and rushed to join them.</p>
<hr />

<p>The weather was clear and bright as the company travelled to Eraia. Afina walked with her fingers laced together, inspecting her surroundings. Travelling wasn‚Äôt new to her; she HAD been sent to live to Theanovene for some time now. She turned back to examine her entourage. How they walked, what they carried. It was interesting how their articles reflected how they were as people. She glanced at her own attire. Formal, yet simple and clearly proud of her heritage. Quite true.</p>

<p>She glanced at the laguz in her company. The only assumptions she made about the laguz people were those that had been validated by science. She wondered if that meant that they had inexplicable urges to howl at the moon, or to lick their bodies clean with their tongue. Laguz WERE proven to take on characteristics of their animal counterparts. But no that would be dumb, she had never seen a laguz lick‚Ä¶ Afina‚Äôs deep (and, clearly, complex) reverie was interrupted as Elfriede announced that they should have no trouble getting past the border guards.</p>

<p>She nodded, thanking him for his assistance, and even laughing politely at his side comment. But furthermore, Afina still vaguely considered whether she HAD seen a cat laguz lick themselves clean.</p>

<p><strong>Kailyn (John B)</strong> - <em>2017-10-23</em></p>

<p>Kailyn stands by her bed, her supplies organized on the sheets. She tossed out the dress that she wore on arrival, instead wearing a green tunic with light grey pants and leather shoes, an outfit given to her during her travels. There was other parts to the ensemble, but she didn‚Äôt think it was wise to dress like a gypsy.  It was much easier to walk around and was much less flashy. She kept the ribbon from her hair and packed in her bag, thinking it was a nice accessory.</p>

<p>She began packing and equipping her possessions along with what was given to her by Itory, including a small lockpick set, a couple of daggers kept around her waist for protection, a book for light reading, and- <em>sigh</em>. She looks at the small package wrapped with leather and twine. She reminisces a bit and begins to wonder, should I just leave this in Theanovene? There was no where she could leave it and she didn‚Äôt have anyone she trusted enough, but at the same time it could get her into trouble; although she questions how much the rest of her party trusts her anyway‚Ä¶</p>

<p>She stores the package among the rest of her gear, keeping it hidden, and began to head downstairs. She looked around for a bit, not really noting how much nicer this tower looks on the inside versus its bland exterior. Perhaps she would‚Äôve stayed a few more days if she had the time. In hindsight she always has the time, but she finds something off with the idea of staying in Theanovene longer than she has to. Besides, she has some magic to learn.</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2017-10-23</em></p>

<p>After consuming a giant meal Atalantia thought it‚Äôd be best to depart to her room so that she may recover before the journey ahead. 
Atalantia observed the soft, cloud-like bed that was provided to her. She was far more used to firm bedding arrangements found in her clan, that were often covered with blankets made from the fur of hunted animals. To a point, the soft bedding made Atalantia uneasy.
<em>Nobles must be very careless and trusting‚Ä¶ my people would never rely on such comfortable beds. If I were to sleep on such a comfortable bedding, I would surely fall into deep slumber, which would make me susceptible to harm</em> Atalantia thought to herself.</p>

<p>Atalantia then looked towards her Uinpeng clothing in a heap on the floor. <em>I keep seeing these southerners in heavy steel armor. How could they possibly move around in such an outfit</em> she thinks to herself. Atalantia is much more used to the lighter hide armor that is traditionally used in her tribe. Made from the pelts of the native bears and elk that call her forests home. The hide armor she wears is engraved with a norse pattern that is only made for the most elite fighters of her clan. Beneath the armor is a wool tunic to prevent chafing as well as keep her warm in the cold north. Through her travels south she has been neglecting to wear the tunic due to the warmer climate. Atalantia wears nothing beneath her armor other than the tunic since her most intense travel is done in wolf form so now, without the tunic her skin is bare and occasionally draws the eyes of onlookers. Her wrists are protected by the same hide bracers that have a similar norse pattern on them.</p>

<p>Her lower body is surprisingly unprotected by contrast. Beneath her waist she only has leather boots, lined on the inside with fox fur hunted in her home forests, and thinner pants  made of wool rings that allow for a perfect balance of mobility and warmth, which fit snugly on her legs demonstrating her muscular figure. Around her waist is a thick leather strap that has two loops on each side for storing her leaf-shaped blades. Each loop has a button latch to keep the swords in place; however, the swords are not stored in a scabbard so they are often in need of maintenance to prevent corrosion and non-battle related wear.</p>

<p>After analyzing both the bedding and her own equipment, Atalantia thought it‚Äôd be best to set up a bed on the floor.  Atalantia spread out her tunic, and slept peacefully for the duration of the night before the journey ahead.</p>

<p>The next morning, Atalantia put on all her equipment and braced herself for the travel. She was looking forward to showing her allies what it is like to travel as a wolf, as well as become one more step closer to completing her challenge of forming a symbol of alliance with Afina. During all of this time, Atalantia was mentally preparing  which of her many songs to sing first during the course of the journey.</p>
