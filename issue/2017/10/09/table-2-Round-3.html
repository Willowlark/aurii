<p><strong>Round 3</strong></p>

<p>Itory looks over each of the guests before nodding all the collected guests. “Please wait here. I will inform Milady of your requests.” he says after putting on a pleasant service smile. He steps back and closes the doors into the tower.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the door’s handle clinks as it’s opened again. Itory opens the door fully and steps aside with the door.</p>

<p>“Milady will meet you now.” he says simply before leading them into the tower itself. The tower feels warm on the inside, lit by firelight in every corner. There’s a staircase to the left of the entrance and a short passage forward before a door. Itory leads the group to the right instead, the corridor curving around the rim of the tower slightly before coming to another door. He opens the door and gestures the guests into the large library beyond the door. Across the room sits the lady of the tower, behind a large ornate desk covered in paper and books.</p>

<p>“This is Afina Tyndall, Princess of Laera, of the Callorian Alliance.” Itory says formally, announcing the title will practiced ease. Once each of the guests enter he closes the door behind them. Itory then takes his place on the right side of the room, closer to Afina than the visitors.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2017-10-09</em></p>

<p><em>Elfriede does a slight practiced bow of his head with one arm across his chest</em></p>

<p>“Lady Tyndall, if I may, I am Knight-Lieutenant Elfriede. I’ve come to deliver a letter to you. I unfortunately have no more information to offer other then that.”</p>

<p><em>Elfriede hands the letter outward to give to Itory, then glaces around the library</em></p>

<p>“Quite a beautiful room you have, could lose myself for a while in here I’m sure.”
<em>He looks back and smiles warmly</em></p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2017-10-10</em></p>

<p>Once Elfriede finishes speaking, Atalantia proudly steps forward, and quickly nods her head in acknowledgement of Afina.</p>

<p>“Hello Afina Tyndall, I have traveled long and far with the intent to form a symbol of alliance with you. Upon visiting the Callorian Kingdom, I had been informed that you reside in this tower. I want to make it clear that I have little to no knowledge on who you actually are or why you have chosen to stay here. Although I do know that I must gain this symbol of alliance and I must do so peacefully” <em>Atalantia tries to explain her case without going too heavily into detail.</em></p>

<p><strong>Kailyn (John B)</strong> - <em>2017-10-11</em></p>

<p><em>Kailyn curtsied, head lowered and position held in respect of the princess. She knew of Callorian traditions, the introductions and manners that are taught among nobles, and she would use them to full effect.</em></p>

<p>“It is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance Princess Afina of Laera.” she gave a slight pause to raise herself back with the others. “I am but a maiden of the Callorian kingdoms, here for knowledge of the arcane arts. I am hopeful that you, a noble of Callora, may be willing to aid me on my quest. You may call me K.”</p>

<p><em>She rethinks to herself what cards she has in her sleeves. Perhaps it will be as easy asking, but she hasn’t come this far by being an optimist.</em></p>
