<p><strong>Round 3</strong></p>

<p>On the other side of the market, a starry eyed youth wanders about on a quest of his own. The market is especially busy where he enters from, his vision blocked by the wood stalls that made the area look more like a carnival than a market. While not young enough to provoke worried looks he’s not old enough to be just another man on the street and the occasional shop keeper looks his way.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2017-10-09</em></p>

<h2 id="as-requested-the-customers-all-lined-up-dealing-with-this-ought-to-be-easy-and-then-i-can-take-a-break-nokri-thought">As requested, the customers all lined up. ‘<em>Dealing with this ought to be easy, and then I can take a break</em>,’ Nokri thought.</h2>
<p>First up was mister blue-cloak, who was surprisingly congenial. His quip about her notorious store caught Nokri’s interest. “Oh, really?” she giggled in response. “Never knew I had such a name for myself!”</p>

<p>Something caught the stranger’s eye across the way and he waved, but whoever or whatever it was had moved away from the window by the time Nokri glanced up there. It was true that more and more people were recognizing her. Perhaps a change in location was in order, or she could count how much savings had been stored up and lay low for a bit. With recognition came its downsides and it’s best to be safe than sorry.</p>

<p>“So you’re in the market to relieve muscle pain? Of course I’ve got just the thing!” It was a common request, and so right at the edge of the table were a half-dozen or so bottles, each containing a yellow-red liquid and a label that read ‘pain relief’ if you stood back and squinted long enough. Mixed in were one or two bottles of a thicker brown liquid that read <em>for fatigue</em>.</p>

<p>“The ones on the table there have a tart flavor to them because they contain cherries and other fruit, but if you’d prefer something else I’m sure I have a different flavor!” Though, the latter option probably wouldn’t actually soothe anything, seeing as she would just be taking a random unmarked vial from behind the display. Nokri was also at least 60% certain that was the was trying to sell wasn’t expired. They were bottled within the last two or three weeks, probably, and definitely kept out of direct sunlight for most of the day. She’d make a new batch once her current one either sold out or turned obviously rancid.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Next in line was a laguz, speaking so low that Nokri had to lean in and seriously concentrate to hear him. Though laguz weren’t an odd sight in Theanovene, Nokri found them weird. It wasn’t until she came to the city a year ago that she saw one in real life for the first time. Most of her customers were humans, though a beastperson might stop by every blue moon. Did human medicine even work on laguz? She had no idea.</p>

<p>“Oh my. Is that rare?” she asked upon hearing that this customer couldn’t transform. Laguz transformation was, again, something she had little knowledge of and only ever saw in the form of drawings in books. She looked at the customer and steadily met his gaze, trying not to stare at his ears or think of distracting questions (‘<em>if he looks like an animal does he smell like an animal? Asking would probably be rude</em>’). If this transformation issue was a big problem, maybe it would be worth researching for profit.</p>

<p>“I’ve never heard of such a thing, but I’m also not very well-versed in laguz issues. I could sell you some nutritional supplements if it’s a physical issue, but at the moment I’m not sure if I have something that’ll help. What have you already tried?” Knowing what doesn’t already work would be a great first step and save her a ton of time, plus the trouble of having to find a guinea pig to test on.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>The third customer was another laguz. ‘<em>Huh. Two in one day.</em>’ Oddly, he was carrying a crate for her. The one that was probably supposed to be delivered five days ago.  Why here and now, of all places? She internally sighed, now knowing that she had a heavy box to take care of and a customer who probably wouldn’t buy anything.</p>

<p>“You carried that all the way here?” Nokri gasped in fake concern. “I’m sure you’re tired, but can I trouble you to bring it inside this general store here? Tell ‘em it’s mine and to put it in the back, they shouldn’t give you trouble.” In truth she would need the crate at home, but no way in hell was she letting anyone know where she lived. It would take all evening but she could store the crate at the shop and carry its contents home bit by bit. If the shopkeeper didn’t like it she could just withhold his wife’s treatment and that’d sure shut him up.</p>

<p>“Hey, take one of these anti-inflammatory potions when you’re done. It’ll help with any muscle fatigue you’ve got after lugging that crate around,” she said, gesturing to the reddish potions she offered to the first customer. <em>They’re going bad and have to go anyway</em>.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>The last customer had disappeared for a short while and Nokri lost sight of him while dealing with the others. But soon enough she spotted the strange cloaked figure in line again. “Thanks for waitin’! What can I help you with?” she asked. “Perhaps one of these?” she jested, holding up another anti-soreness potion. “It’s been a real big seller today! Or are you in the market for something else?”</p>

<p><strong>ZaRel (Nick)</strong> - <em>2017-10-10</em></p>

<p>Weaving between people in the crowd is a trivial task for ZaRel. Finding someone in it is another matter entirely, especially since his eye level is around the average shoulder level of most people in the crowd. His ash white hair, which is just long enough to cover his ears, gets tossed around with each well placed step he takes to avoid yet another person who did’t see him in the hustle and bustle of the market.</p>

<p>He looks around for the large man that he heard a rumor of when he first came to this continent. <em>Large and intimidating. Large and intimidating.</em> He chants to himself in his mind. Within what seems like the most unorganized chaos he has ever seen, being the business of the market, he notices an orderly line of people waiting to speak with a girl even smaller than ZaRel himself. And first in that line, a large and intimidating man crouching down in a seemingly gentle way speaking with the girl. <em>Large, intimidating, and a hero to children! This must be the man from the rumor!</em></p>

<p>ZaRel increases his pace and weaves through the crowd in a rush to get to this man before he moves on to another place. Surely a man a well traveled as the man from the rumors doesn’t stay in any one place for long. Just as suddenly as ZaRel increases his pace, the market becomes even more crowded to a point where ZaRel even begins to have trouble squeezing his way through. He looks back and notices a larger number of people looking at him than when he first got to the market. He then realizes his hair, through the constant tossing from weaving his way through the crowd, has gotten stuck behind his ear revealing the pointed tips. ZaRel immediately covers his ears again and tries to push is way through the throng of people now in his way. <em>I can’t let these people stop me from getting to him!</em></p>

<p>By the time ZaRel makes it through the crowd the large man is no longer at the girl’s stand, but is instead making his way into the store she is set up outside of. ZaRel walks over and manages to walk into the general store right behind that large man. With a voice backed by unquestioned confidence, ZaRel grabs the mans cloak and speaks to him. “Sir, I’ve traveled a long way to find a man matching your description. I would like to establish if you are in fact the man I’ve heard rumors of.”</p>

<p><strong>Ienzo (john g)</strong> - <em>2017-10-10</em></p>

<p>As Ienzo thanks the friendly shopkeep and prepares to walk away he remembers he wanted to check out the general shop in front of him. As he enters he great the man he saw gazing out the window and begins to look around. As he walks around he begins to think to himself, “After you been in so many general stores they all seem to look the same, the only things that change are the faces”. After inspecting several shelves he feels a tug on his cloak. He looks over to see a rather small figure next to him asking to speak to him. “Hello friend, you wish to speak to me about a rumor? If that’s what you want I’m free to talk, let’s move somewhere less crowded before we speak so no unwanted attention gets drawn.? The two leave the general store and look for a rather private place to converse.</p>

<p><strong>Heroth</strong> - <em>2017-10-10</em></p>

<p>Ewan had made it to the front of the line at the potion stall, and after learning it was mostly harmless and word of mouth from a few disgruntled customers had distorted it’s reputation, he wasn’t quite sure what to buy. The sound of a potion that relived soreness is a luxury Ewan normally didn’t concern himself during his travels. He had been tracking a platoon of Dreca forces, but the trail had gone cold in town, and while trying to gain information on where the platoon was heading heard tale of this potion stall. 
‘Perhaps fate has brought he here to rest,’ Ewan thought to himself. 
At any rate the inn seemed like a decent spot for information, and it would be good to try a potion in a safe spot just to make sure the rumors aren’t true.
“I think I will see what all the excitement is about and try your tonic good madam.”
Ewan paid for his muscle relief elixir and went back inside the inn. He found an empty seat in the back corner of the bar area of the inn. He order a small drink to have with the potion while Knoll sat under the table circling around Ewan robes. Ewan keeps scanning the room and kept his ears open to listen for any news of attacks by Dreca while the effect of the potion begins to take effect</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-10-10</em></p>

<p>Disappointment comes over Aldus almost immediately at the potion seller responds. She obviously not familiar with laguz if she has to ask that question. Something that is made more apparent by the fact that her eyes start wandering to his grey and brown ears atop his head before she locks eyes with him directly. He tries not to let his emotions display on his face too much though as to not offend her, although his first impression isn’t great, and his faith in her abilities is now low he decides to entertain her further questioning.</p>

<p>“Well I’ve tried quite the array or herbs and roots, I’ve switched my diet multiple times, and also tried meditation and stretching rituals. No other laguz I know or have heard of has this issue, so yes it is quite rare. Perhaps you might have an associate or another person you might recommend to me? Perhaps someone with more experience in my species?” He hopes he’s not coming across as rude, he offers a shy smile to try and lighten his tone.</p>
