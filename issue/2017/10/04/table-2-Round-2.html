            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-10-04</em></p>

<p><strong>Round 2</strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs barely a moment after Atalania arrives at the oak doors that they open to a well dressed man. While certainly not peasant tier, his clothes don‚Äôt give off the impression of a noble, particularly because of the muted colors. His hair is blond, with a high hair line despite the tips of his ears being covered by his hair. He has a groomed mustache over a pair of pursed lips.</p>

<p>He looks over Atalania first, taking in her bold expression. His nose twitches. He glances to the other girl, dressed as finely as one can without a tailor‚Äôs services. His lip twitches in time with her ears. He finally turns to the last person at the door, the one in Eraian military garb. His eyebrow rises at the insignia on the soldier‚Äôs plate.</p>

<p>Ending his scan he stands a little straight, subtly stepping into the door frame completely. ‚ÄúGood Afternoon ladies and gentleman. I am Itory, and I serve the lady of the tower. I‚Äôm afraid I must ask each of your purposes for calling; the lady is currently engaged. I‚Äôll bring your concerns to milady and return with news if she acquiesces to see you at this time.‚Äù He says with practiced ease.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2017-10-04</em></p>

<p>The boy matches the look from the man at the door. A butler?</p>

<p>‚ÄúI am Knight-Leiutenant Elfriede Faun, and I am here with a letter from Eraia for the Lady though I know not its contents.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2017-10-04</em></p>

<p>Atalantia stands in a confident manner hoping that this man, who stands before her, might be able to lead her to the daughter of the royal family of Laera.
‚ÄúHello Itory, I have traveled a long distance in search of the daughter of the royal family in Laera. Upon visiting the Callorian Kingdom, I have been informed that the princess awaits here, yet I do not know why. I have come in peace and my only wish is to form a symbol of alliance with the princess‚Äù Atalantia eagerly says in response to Itory‚Äôs question.</p>

<p><strong>Kailyn (John B)</strong> - <em>2017-10-05</em></p>

<p><em>Kailyin adjusted herself, patting herself off of dust from the sudden shove. She wasn‚Äôt sure what to think of the wolf laguz, but decided that would be a question for another time. She then rose up only to lower herself to greet the servant in the Collerian fashion.</em></p>

<p>‚ÄúHello to you Itory. You may refer to me as K, and I am a maiden seeking an audience with your lady.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>She rises back up to look at the butler eye to eye.</em></p>

<p>‚ÄúI do not need to rush, but it appears that the princess should answer our calls sooner rather than later, especially if its of a message of such great importance to be held by a ranked knight and an envoy of‚Ä¶‚Äù Kailyn stuttered for a second in slight bewilderment, ‚Äúpeace?‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2017-10-05</em></p>

<p>Afina hesitated when she heard the faint sound of knocking and the creak of the main tower doors opening. Losing concentration, the light she had just conjured popped and fizzled out, like a spark jumping out of a fireplace. ‚ÄúDumb!‚Äù she hissed at it, slamming her book shut. It wasn‚Äôt often she used the common curses of Laera, but a failed magic attempt certainly warranted one. She huffed. Better luck next time.</p>

<p>Afina cracked the door of the library open, squinting down the hall to peer at who might be at the door. Itory, naturally, stood in the doorway to block the visitor from view. Afina didn‚Äôt get many visitors nowadays, occasionally messengers would come from home to deliver letters, sometimes beggars would come in their dirtiest clothes begging for scrap (often she would instruct Itory to give them a book and some bread and be gone). But rarely were visitors ever there to see /Afina/. More often than not, people often came seeking her father, King Achelous, and were disappointed to see the less-renowned princess. She frowned. Another inane visitor and she may just lose her head. ‚ÄúItory, who‚Äôs at the door?‚Äù</p>
