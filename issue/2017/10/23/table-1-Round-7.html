</div>

<p>The Captain slams his blade against the door frame even harder when a story tall dragon replaced the brat on his right. His purpose for breaking through had changed completely however, his swings not powerful but frantic. Be that the cause of some other form of warped luck, he manages to force the splitering door bar apart and barrels into the room. Regalus is slammed into the wall behind the open door and the captain tumbles to the ground halfway into the room. He doesn’t even look in Nokri’s direction, he instead crawls behind the store counter completely out of sight. Regalus groans from behind the door, bruised but otherwise okay.</p>

<p>The men outside are rightly confused to see a dragon of all things, let alone one spouting retorhic about being a god. However, due to their familiarity with the Wyverns of Dreca’s mountains and the natural response to kill what one is afraid of, they continue fighting. Some look for their captain, unable to spot him in his new position.</p>

<p>The onlookers renew their shouts and screams, far louder than when the fighting broke out. Many ran of course, but some are rooted to the spot. Pushing through them, from the northeast and south sides of the market respectively, are a group of Theanovene militiamen and Eraian soldiers. The Theanovene men, while not real soldiers, do their damnest to get up to the fighting and take some of the pressure off of the group fighting. They immediately engage the Drecians while shouting that Theanovene is neutral ground and if they don’t cease their hositilites the council will be involved. An astute member of your group might notice they are also looking at you all while saying that.</p>

<p>The Eraians on the otherhand, had to pause for a moment. Each of them stared with awe at the dragon only a dozen yards from them. It only took one unsheathing his blade for the rest to follow.</p>

<p>“That dragon is an agent of Lyarlel! It must be destroyed before it corrupts more of Lylalel’s light! Slaughter it men, for this is a holy crusade!” one shouts and the lot of them charge with the fervor Eraia is known for.</p>

<p>(ooc: The Theanovene men are allies for your group; they’ve reduced the drecian threat level, which was a bit high in hindsight (first ever combat rounds woo). The Eraians are not fully engaged yet and what becomes of them depends on your actions in the coming turn.)</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-10-26</em></p>

<p>The arrow hits its target just as a dagger thrown by a mustached man whizzes over his head. But then everything stops. Aldus stops too as the boy who was punching the capitan earlier transforms into a - dragon? A large purple dragon. As the dragon boy begins speaking to the attackers Aldus feels his lip quiver slightly and moves to duck back behind the ridge of the roof.</p>

<p>For a moment Aldus thinks that maybe the dragon boy’s scare tactic will work. At least it works on the leader. But then he hears a rallying cry from the Drecians as they move to attack the dragon. Two new groups appear in the marketplace as well. From the roof he can see that the Theanovenes mean to help them out a bit here, even if they are shooting side-long glances to Aldus and the others as well. Another group of soldiers appears also, these ones wearing purple and black uniforms. Eraians? This new group makes a rally against the dragon boy as well.</p>

<p>Aldus shifts nervously If I knew I was going to be caught in my own little world war maybe I would have stopped for tea and avoided this whole deal. He thinks to himself.</p>

<p>Aldus moves to the edge of the roof and leaps gracefully into a roll and onto the ground behind the building. He proceeds to quickly walk out in front of the Erain soldiers facing them, figuring the Drecians are preoccupied with the dragon at this moment.</p>

<p>“Hey-hey-hey why don’t we just take a minute here and assess this situation. Im sure the good citizens of Theanovene would appreciate not having their streets coated in the gallons of blood that would surely come from a creature such as that, and I believe everyone here has seen enough blood for today - I know I have. Why don’t you fine ladies and gentlemen help us, and the Theanovene militia detain these Drecian soldiers instead? Their leader happens to be hiding right behind that shop counter over there” Aldus says pointing to where the leader is cowered. “I’m sure he could offer you some information on Dreca’s battle plans and whatnot, which I’m sure your military would find invaluable, and look at that! They all seem to be distracted, nows our chance!“ Aldus turns out toward the marketplace with a sweeping motion of his hand, once his back is turned he meets eyes with the dragon, struggling not to shudder and mouths “GO!”  hoping that his way with words is half as good as it was at home.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2017-10-26</em></p>

<p>“<strong>**</strong>! Why the <strong>**</strong> did I stay behind?” Nokri screamed at herself, but it was too little too late. The door had busted down and for all she knew without seeing his wounds Regalus was crawling off to die. As the Drecan captain fell to the ground Nokri sprinted out the doorway, taking the first opening she could to escape however far she could make it without being caught or followed. It was impossible to tell who was on what side, or even if the original conflict was still occurring given that one of her customers was now a giant smoke-exhaling lizard taking the brunt of the fighting.</p>

<p>Quickly as possible, she went around the side of the building. The glass shards on the ground from earlier crunched underfoot, slowing her movements and getting stuck in her shoes. A laguz fell from the sky right in front of her as she turned the corner and caused her to falter, but he was busy with other things to pay her any mind. Escape was Nokri’s number one priority and she set off running once again, keeping her eyes low to the ground and prepared to barrel into anyone who might get in her way.</p>
