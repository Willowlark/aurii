<h1 id="how-is-it-done">How is it done?</h1>

<p>Many are familiar with the mage these days. Magic wielders have become a normal, if unusual sight since the invention of the magic tome. Let us be very clear as well, when we say mage it does not refer to anyone who can call forth fire from a book. Those who work with magic have their own scale of seniority, much like the guilds in Theanovene. Rookies are referred to as <em>Pupils</em> and study under another caster. After many years they may finally set out on their own as <em>Mages</em>. The greatest of mages, those who have made breakthroughs studying the secrets of magic, are bestowed the title of <em>Sage</em>. As good Theanovians, knowing a caster’s title is a must.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ironically, many of the people who travel Aurii today as “Mages” are actually only Pupils. To hold the title of Mage a spellcaster must be able to not just use a tome to perform feats of magic; but be able to cast ritual spells unaided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most types of magic we see in the day to day are cast via <em>Magic Tomes</em>. Tomes are created through a particular ritual spell discovered in the last century. The Tome ritual imbues the pages of the book with nonsensical shapes, diagrams, and letters, and yet when a spell is cast using the book provides magic without the hours of ritual work. While the page is consumed, disappearing as if burned instantly, Tomes tend to hold a few dozen of their spells.</p>

<p>The are a few requirements still even when using a tome, which are good for everyone to know.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A caster must be able to speak the spell’s name to cast a spell from a tome. If ever assaulted by a spellcaster, stuffing their mouth can give you time to escape and find help.</li>
  <li>The caster’s tome must remain open and held for the duration of the spell. The power flows from the book (in layman’s terms of course!) and when the book is closed the spell ends. This limits a caster’s mobility, again giving you a chance to escape.</li>
  <li>Certain spells (particularly those in the <em>Elder magic</em> category) require additional materials to be cast.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-types-of-magic">The types of Magic</h1>

<p>Magic is often described as “harnessing the force of nature in Aurii to do one’s bidding”. While at first glance one can see how fire and lightning are forces of nature, the other breeds of magic such as Light and Elder are less apparent. We’ve dug into a cursory summary for each brand of magic and just why they’re classified differently.</p>

<h2 id="anima">Anima</h2>

<p>Anima magic is the magic of nature. This includes all the forces we of the world are familiar with. Fire is the most common Anima magic, followed by Lightning and then Wind. Tomes for these elements are almost common, though still not as easy to acquire as a sword. Fire’s scalding heat, Lightning searing force, and Wind’s blustering utility make them a go to for most Pupils looking to learn.</p>

<p>Anima magic does extend further than just the core elements however. Mages and Sages in Aurii have mastered water, ice, and even earthen stone. While spells for these elements are more rudimentary or “raw” (Sage Osbury Nonim, Theanovene), they are an evolving field of study for many Sages. The mere action of casting them already marks one as a talented individual, and improving them is a way into the history books.</p>

<p>Effects Manifested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Projectile</li>
  <li>Brute manipulation (forcing a campfire into a piller of flame)</li>
  <li>Reinforcement (Increasing the strength of the element in nature)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="light">Light</h2>

<p>Light magic is classified as the magic of one’s beliefs. Despite the rather confusing classification, light magic is just as common as Anima magic on Aurii. Light magic manifests as a golden light, and when used offensively it feels like pure, searing force against the body. It tends to appear bright as well, sometimes blindingly so.</p>

<p>Belief is not as clear a magic as nature is. The greatest Sages in the field of Light magic cannot explain it anymore than the newest Pupils. The only thing that can be said is that the more you believe, the easier the magic will come to you. Even more interestingly, what you believe doesn’t seem to matter. Many are quick to associate believe with the religion of Lylalel in Eraia; yet any devoted person can use Light magic. Even those who do not believe in the god can invoke Light magic, believing in concepts, people, or even in Light magic itself.</p>

<p>Due to the strange nature of Light magic, attempts to research it work against the researcher. By explaining the magic one’s understanding of it pulls away from belief. Discovery in Light magic is rare, most of them made by accident. The origin of Light magic is a often researched topic; if researching weakens its power how was it initially discovered? While we know the origin of Light no more than the other forms of magic, the paradox of Light magic specifically makes it particularly interesting.</p>

<p>Effects Manifested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Point Flares (Miniature explosions of searing hot light)</li>
  <li>Light flashes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="elder">Elder</h2>

<p>Elder magic is the least common form of magic on Aurii, or perhaps it should be called the least accepted. Elder magic is categorized as magic that requires a sacrifice to cast and from that it gets it more common name Dark magic. What is sacrificed can vary, some spells demand unique components while others are more powerful depending on what you use. Despite there being rather mundane sacrifices (3 days rotten fruit for example) available, Dark magic is well defined by it’s more gruesome sacrifices such as raw animal organs or pieces of the human body.</p>

<p>Dark magic may have it’s downsides, yet it has an avid following of underground users. The reason for this is two fold, the first being dark magic manifests far more powerfully than the other schools of magic. It’s assumed that this power comes from the sacrificed object, it’s destruction turning into the inky force that manifests from basic dark magic incantation.</p>

<p>The second reason is Dark magic can do more than any other type of magic; more unique effects have been discovered through the realm of Dark magic than any other. While we were able to find a dark magic sage to speak to, we’ve been assured by third parties that the sages theorize any kind of effect could be invoked with dark magics, if only we knew the correct combination of words and sacrifices. As research into dark magic is heavily frowned upon in all the kingdoms of Aurii.</p>

<p>Effects Manifested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Materialized Shadow (a black, oozing substance that powers from a sacrifice, both numbs and burns humans and can be manipulated by the caster.)</li>
  <li>Degradation (Speeds up the decay of an object, requires a very large sacrifices for much effect)</li>
  <li>Cold fire</li>
  <li>Animation of the Dead</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="healing-arts">Healing Arts</h2>

<p>The healing arts are a strange subclass of magic. They’re quite common, yet they have no sages nor researchers. Healing arts are naught but a few spells, each with a specific use case. They were discovered decades ago in an ancient text and no other mention of them has been found. These spells interact positively with the human body, healing and curing the body. They’ve been placed in tomes the same way the other school have and are used in a similar fashion, yet we know even less about it than we do other forms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Restorative (cures wounds and other damages to the body)</li>
  <li>Curing (removes ailments to the body, such as illness or curse)</li>
  <li>Relief (numbs pain or other feelings or effects)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="ancient-magics">Ancient Magics?</h1>

<p>Despite this being an expose into the study of magic, each of the paragraph above has a sentence using the word Unknown. Magic is as intriguing as it is to us because we do not understand it despite how well we utilize what we do know. Sages dedicate their lives to discovering even a handful of new facts about magic, for personal fame or the betterment of Aurii.</p>

<p>We are not the first generation to study the effects of spellcraft as well. Plenty of significant discoveries in this field actually came from men and women long dead, revealed to us by notes they’ve left behind for the future. These discoveries have led to us making new discoveries as well. At the same time, some only show us more of the mysteries that is spellcraft. Ancient texts refer to magic in different ways, or to effects we can’t possibly create with magic as it is now. This only drives sages to valid the past and discover what was lost to time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anima magic is referred to the <em>natural magic</em> or <em>ordered magic</em> and has definitions referencing that it <em>follows the natural order.</em></li>
  <li>Dark magic is written as <em>elder magic</em>, <em>unordered magic</em>, or <em>unnatural magic</em>. Definitions for it all center around two topics, <em>tribute</em> or <em>defying nature</em>.</li>
  <li>Light magic is rarely referenced in what writings have been found. When it is referenced, it’s referred to as <em>ordering magic</em> or <em>pure magic</em>. Definitions are too vague to be summarized when it comes to light magic, often what the texts refer to is something that no one can do with current light magic.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="ritual-casting-and-other-advanced-techniques">Ritual Casting and other Advanced Techniques</h1>

<p>Everyone is aware of the tome creation process which brought magic into the modern era. Despite it’s common place status, many don’t realize the connection between it and the ritual magic that’s considered old fashion. Tome creation is nothing more than a ritual spell. The spell has a focus of a prepared book and a casting time of 8 hours, using a spell circle as a guide. Once a pupil has advanced to the rank of Mage and can create a tome in this way, they have an easy source of income. Many pupils stop at this point, only interested in the business aspect of magic.</p>

<p>The process for tomes reveals most of what can be said for ritual magic. Rituals require various components and a large amount of time to cast. Ritual versions of every spell ever placed in a tome exist, though with their long casting times the usefulness is up in the air. Though involved with magical research are required to spend the hours per casting however. Rituals allow for finite adjustments, turning the mysterious art of magic into something comparable to a science. With a little stronger focus or a different shape to a spell circle the effect of a spell might change drastically. Ritual magics require a very in depth knowledge of magical theory. If you met someone who can discuss them academically, be sure to show the proper respect.</p>
