            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-10-30</em></p>

<p>Ransford’s face is still. The only thing to move is his eyes, slowing tracing from Afina, to the two laguz, and finally to Elfreide. His stony look doesn’t soften as he speaks.</p>

<p>“I don’t recall asking any of you to go bandit hunting. At the most I asked you to relay a message did I not?” he says. He doesn’t expect an answer, his tone most assuredly rhetorical. “Eraia does not need foreigners, led alone foreign nobility to deal with it’s problems.” he straightens Afina’s papers by tapping them against his desk.</p>

<p>Ransford doesn’t look at your party as he stands up. “Your papers are in order. Do what you wish when you leave, and I am required to warn you to avoid the path into the woods on the west, no more than a mile further south. There are…” his brow twitches slightly. “Bandits, down that trail. Be safe in your travels, may Lylalel light your path.” He finishes, and turns on his heel. He nods to the other guardsman in the room as he steps through the door into the rest of the station.</p>

<p>The remaining guardsman looks at the party only once before snapping to attention as he presumably guards the inner section of the guardhouse from unauthorized entry.</p>

<p>(ooc: You can spend more time talking or wrap up your time at the guard house in this round, just mention where you’re going next and I’ll transition in the next round.)</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2017-10-30</em></p>

<p><em>Elfriede sighs and rolls his eyes a bit</em></p>

<p><em>He taps the commander’s shoulder before he leaves</em></p>

<p>“Hey, would you send word via the next courier and tell them why we’re behind schedule. I’d appreciate it.”</p>

<p><em>He about-faces and walks over to Afina and passes her, eyeing her all the way</em></p>

<p><em>Elfriede stops in the doorway not turning his head</em></p>

<p>“Well I’m ready when you are… Lets have it done then. We’ve more sunlight before we have to make camp for the night. I’d like to make as much progress as we can tonight. Maybe even get this whole ordeal done before sunset.”</p>

<p><em>He re-adjusts his supplies and stretches and walks away.</em></p>

<p><strong>Afina (Georgia🍀 )</strong> - <em>2017-11-02</em></p>

<p>Afina’s face begins to flush red hot with embarrassment. She bows her head as the commander rises, mumbling a curt “thank you, sir” as he walks away. With a sigh, she turns on her heel, gaze fixated on the floor. “You heard him, let’s get moving,” she says, fingers digging into the straps on her pack as she follows Elfriede out the door.</p>

<p>This was ridiculous! The Eraian guards should have been thankful. Why did they act so offended? And worse over, disappointed. What did she do? It felt like she had to fight her party defending what she wanted to do, only to cave in to what’s “right” and be passive-aggressively admonished! She rolled her eyes. Duty comes before all is right. She had always stuck to her guns in the past. Now, the one time she gives the others the benefit of the doubt, she embarasses herself.</p>

<p>She haughtily glanced at her laguz companions. If science was to be understood, which naturally, it was, the laguz tend to take the traits of the animals they associate with. There was a reason that cats and wolves were always the sneaky antagonists in the stories. She had to be more on her guard, the real world was clearly not as straightforward as the stories she used to read.</p>

<p>In front of her walked Elfriede, his usual (no doubt, practiced) military posture not betraying a single thought. An individual of principle and duty, he took the charge of protecting her very seriously. Perhaps he was the only one playing for “Team Afina”, as it were. Atalantia only wanted her for the seal she could potentially bestow, and K’s intentions alone were wholly unclear beyond simple “learning”. Afina sped up her pace to catch up to Elfriede, deeming she needed more information before trusting the laguz in her company. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Atalantia trying to talk to her, and she mumbled a few half-hearted “of course” and “okay”s in response.</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2017-11-02</em></p>

<p>“You know, you don’t have to ask for help in order to receive it. Explaining the problem to ‘foreigners’ is enough of a call for help in my opinion. I do thank you, for pointing us in the right direction towards the bandits at the very least” Atalantia says in response to Ransford’s comments. <em>Atalantia could sense the sass in his voice, which made her quite irritable</em></p>

<p><em>Atalantia looks towards the party, and nods her head, showing that she is ready to depart towards the bandits. She was looking forward to resolving this bandit issue; hopefully this will allow the laguz to be seen in a better light. As it is, Atalantia knew very well that her noble companions judged her and K for being laguz (or at least people of a more “wild” nature). Atalantia had to demonstrate to her companions that she was indeed a great asset to the party, and one that could be trusted.</em></p>

<p><em>As the party begins to depart towards the trail with the bandits, Atalantia sternly looks towards Afina</em>
“I couldn’t help but notice before that you called yourself the ‘leader’ of our party. Are we not all equals here?”</p>

<p>Noticing that Afina isn’t listening she grabs her and turns her to face herself, “Listen to me when I am talking to you! I can’t stand rudeness like that from anybody, let alone a noble who should know better.”</p>

<p>“It’s an important fact that in an alliance, the members must treat each other with trust and fairness. How can we reach this trust and fairness if you view yourself as the ‘leader’ of us all?</p>

<p>Although I do thank you greatly for accepting my plea to take on the bandits. I feel as if this task will prove to be very valuable towards you and your desire to learn about light magic.</p>

<p>I do not view you as our ‘leader,’  I hope you didn’t <em>mistake</em> our discussion as a request for a leader’s decision. It was an effort to convince an ally to accompany myself and K on a mission. You don’t make decisions for me, and the sooner you understand that the faster we will become good friends.”</p>

<p><em>Atalantia then looks towards K with the same serious expression</em> 
“Also, please do not encourage the princess in her delusion of grandeur. I certainly do not ‘serve’ Afina, or anyone for that matter. We are a party, and we must start to treat each other that way. If we convince each other that one of us if better than the other, our party will break apart and we will surely fail our missions.”</p>

<p><em>Atalantia then looks to Elfriede continuing her serious expression</em>
“I understand that you are on orders to protect Afina, and I will not ask you to disrespect your organization by denying the fact that you are technically subordinate to her. But, I do ask you to offer the same respect of not pushing your organization’s ideas on us, and at the very least treat K and I as equals for our journey.”</p>

<p><strong>Kailyn (John B)</strong> - <em>2017-11-02</em></p>

<p>Kailyn approaches Afina, tapping on her shoulder for attention. Kailyn gives a slight smile, leaning forward Afina’s face.</p>

<p>“Your words towards Ransford rang more true than before.”</p>

<p>She waited for Afina to give a sign of recognition to her words, and waited a moment after to speak again.</p>

<p>“However, please remember that you aren’t the only one here. Our lives are also on the line as well as yours.”</p>

<p>Kailyn then moves up aside her, looking at the road ahead instead.</p>

<p>“You said you were a suitable teacher for the numerous teachers that you had, when instead your teachers were suitable for their experience that they gained through a lifetime of thinking and communication. In the grand scheme of things, we are all teaching each other for a better idea, towards a harder goal.”</p>

<p>Kailyn then look softly into Afina’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid to look at us as equals.”</p>

<p>Kailyn then moved aside, following the rest of the pack on the road. She heard atalantia’s speech, and although outspoken, certainly rang some truth as well. Kalyn came here for a teacher and now she doesn’t know why she is here. Perhaps she is moving along without purpose, or maybe wanting to aid those who are in need?</p>

<p><em>Only two things were in Kailyn’s mind now. The first being the bandits that should be taken care of. The second…</em></p>

<p><em>“This need not be a human nobility versus laguz issue, don’t get any ideas.”</em></p>

<p><em>Kailyn doesn’t know how to respond from this argument. Beyond anything else, Elfriede ignored the issue and Afina ignored their voice. What did Afina mean when saying “not be wise in Eraian territory” to laguz give a verdict?</em></p>

<p><em>Kailyn has dealt with this before, and she doesn’t want to deal with it again.</em></p>
