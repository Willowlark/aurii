<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Conflict: Dreca doesn't tolerate deserters; You're coming with us!
Dice pool: 4
Threat Level: 0(0)(-4 Theanovians)
RESOLVED
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Despite Aldus’s efforts, the Eraian troops march onward towards ZaRel’s transformed state. They begin to encircle the dragon, waiting for an opportunity to enter within ZaRel’s reach. Unlike the Drecians before the Eraian’s actions are calculated and military; this chance to rid the world of Lyarlel’s creation is far too important to not take as seriously as a battle with Dryn Wulfa himself.</p>

<p>After getting between the Drecian soldiers and their opponents, the Theanovene militiamen are able to talk the foreign soldiers down. The fighting breaks up and the Theanovians start rounding up the various combatants. If not for starting a fight in neutral grounds, the damage to property in the area would be more than enough reason to bring all the combatants to the stockades. Nokri’s potion stand is all but destroyed (and the broken bottles are letting off one very powerful stench) while the general store has burn and slash marks on it’s walls and roof.</p>

<p>The Theanovian men started with the Drecians, but as they finish gathering up the military men they divide they’re attention. A few men join the Eraians, attempting to at least prevent massive damages in the fight they can only predict is coming. The rest are turning towards the Drecian’s combatants, two wolf laguz and the martial artist.</p>

<p>(ooc: Combat has been resolved and lessons have been learned. Future combat should be a little better balanced. Anyone who lost all their HP in fight is now at whatever state they’d like to be in; you can be winded and waking up, or you can bounce up as good as new.)</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-10-27</em></p>

<p>While he’s trying to convince them, he sees the potion girl pass the group, running  away from the marketplace and all this trouble. Once it’s clear his feeble attempt at convincing the Erains isn’t going to work, Aldus decides he doesn’t want to stick around to see what’s going to happen next. He runs off toward the direction the potion girl went, hoping he can catch up to her and ask what that was all about. He’s also still holding onto hope that she knows about <em>something</em> that may help him and is hoping to get the chance to ask. Behind him he can hear combat dying down and a couple of shouts, he decides to pick up the pace.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2017-10-30</em></p>

<p>Theanovene was a huge city, perfect for hiding in, but also a pain to enter and exit. With her head down Nokri bumped into quite a few people and caused quite a small stir, but the died blood around her shoulder was just enough cause for people to let her be and not pursue the running girl any further. Adrenaline was pumping through her veins, driving her to escape, but her breaths grew ragged. The din of fighting was left long behind and only the sound of everyday city fare could be heard. Nokri stumbled to a halt a block over from the city entrance, doubling over against the cool wall to catch her breath. The sound of her own heartbeat made listening to the surroundings hard, but she couldn’t discern any threats. The alley she ran into was empty and offered her some peace to calm down.</p>

<p>Sure, she had undergone worse in the military. But that was before, and this was now. Nokri didn’t exactly keep up her hardcore fitness regimen after moving to the city. Plus the fight was so sudden and unexpected. It seemed no matter where she went, Dreca would catch up eventually. So what to do now? Lay low, wait a bit, then pack up and ditch Theanovene. If she could get to her stash of cash Nokri could set up base somewhere new for a few months and earn some profit there before moving on again.</p>

<p>Footsteps nearby brought her train of thought to a screeching halt. Sweat dripped down her face as she looked up menacingly, preparing to rush off in the opposite direction if anyone came by.</p>
