            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-10-26</em></p>

<p>Ransford answers your questions while thumbing through the paper work he’s received from Afina.</p>

<p>“Trisp is on the other side of the kingdom milady, close to the western sea. News about Trisp doesn’t make it out this way often. Well, that’s not only because of the distance.” He pauses for a moment, then remembering he’s not talking to locals, continues. “Trisp is a monastery of sorts. The whole town centers around Lylalel and the manifestation of her light. If you don’t have a vested interest in Lylalel’s magic, nothing coming from Trisp will really interest you.”</p>

<p>Ransford looks up at Atalania’s statement. Despite the even tone of a service man in his voice, one look at his eyes reveals he wasn’t fond of her words. “I don’t see any justification for robbing unarmed caravaneers, be you two eared or or four. Worry you not, no one’s opinions shall hold you up here. This guard station is right lacking in nobility,” he turns to Afina, “Present company excluded of course.”</p>

<p><strong>Atalantia Enneka (Allison)</strong> - <em>2017-10-26</em></p>

<p>“Perhaps you didn’t hear me when I announced that I would like to find a solution to the bandit problem. I am requesting any information that you may have on the bandits, so that I can investigate further and bring this issue to an end. If they are attacking without reason they will be put down, however I am not going to make that assumption on the word of guards who can’t take the time to acknowledge me” Atalantia states fiercely having been ignored for the most part.</p>

<p>Atalantia then faces her party and shows them the determination in her eyes. “I wish not to cause conflict, but this is an issue we MUST resolve. I will always defend my kind, and if they are still acting against the interests of the majority and display a poor image of our kind, I will take matters in my own hands to stop it.”</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2017-10-26</em></p>

<p><em>Elfriede glances back at his furry companions, thinking (and not for the first time) it was indeed a bad idea taking them along.</em></p>

<p><em>He glances over at Afina, sighing with his eyes alone.</em></p>

<p>“Maybe if we start walking she’ll follow us.”</p>

<p>“Come on then, we can always go hunting for the bandits after we make our stop in Eraia and as long as I don’t have any orders against it I intend to return. I want to see the bandits cleansed as  much as any of us.”</p>

<p><em>Impatiently rolled his shoulder both as a tick and to stretch</em></p>

<p>“Besides we’re already at the border, there can’t be that much more journey ahead of us.”</p>

<p><strong>Kailyn (John B)</strong> - <em>2017-10-26</em></p>

<p><em>Kailyn sighed. Perhaps it would’ve been better to keep going forward, but no. Too much had been said.  She put herself in front of all, letting the crowd circle around her.</em></p>

<p>“Sir, I agree that robbing caravaners is unjust, but what makes you believe it is just laguz?” Kailyn paused. “The fact is, my party consists of laguz as well, and I feel that the only trouble brought is of your own words. For am I not a maiden of my own tree and Atalantia of royalty as well. Of course, you wouldn’t know that since you dared not ask a question, only to throw us aside.”</p>

<p>Kailyn then turns to Elfriede, only feeling shame for the knight. “As for you, what is your duty? Are you not to serve and protect? To die for your cause? And yet all I hear is heading to Eraia, avoiding this quest. What will happen when your master gives you another task, as I am sure both you and I are sure he will give. Will you avoid this task still? What cowardice! Avoiding the task at hand for your own self and position.”</p>

<p>Kailyn eyes glared down and Elfriede once more, “And near the border? What lies do you speak! Did this man not say that Trisp was on the other side of the kingdom? And yet you lie to my face. To Atalantia. To all of us.”</p>

<p>Kailyn’s final stare was given to Afina. She paused again, regaining her breath. She gained focus from her last two spouts, ready to speak to royalty once more. “Did you not say, ‘If no one aspires to be ruler then we’ll live in a world full of weak authority thrust into the ruling position’?” She lets the words sink in.
“If that be the case, then is it not as bad letting those of weak authority wander the plains and roads, ransacking those who serve you and the kingdom? Do you not serve the people of this kingdom as we serve you?”</p>

<p>Kailyn then bows. “Please Princess Afina, do not dishonor your name nor my name as a laguz. Let us stop this banditry now.”</p>

<p><strong>Afina (Georgia🍀 )</strong> - <em>2017-10-28</em></p>

<p>Afina silently opened the door, head bowed, the slightest bit embarrassed about the altercation that had occurred previously. Expectant eyes turned towards her, some hopeful and others more cross. “I have come to a decision,” she said, looking at the commander.</p>

<p>“There are many factors to consider in deciding whether to proceed to Eraia or to halt our travels and assist the patrol with their raider issue.That being said, no proper leader would reroute their company so early into their travels. Strategically, this isn’t our fight to fight right now, as we have a duty to fulfill in Trisp.”</p>

<p>“However, a leader doesn’t rule with their head alone. The heart plays a role as well, and it’s only proper and just that we dispose of the bandits before anyone else can be harmed. The simple fact of the matter is that justice isn’t always convenient. There are many factors to consider when weighing the options.”</p>

<p>She walked forward, proceeding to the counter where the commander still sat, arms folded. His gruffy, confident appearance was familiar in an odd sort of way. She lifted her chin, facing away from her company and solely addressing the commander. Perhaps out of fear of seeing their reactions, or the need she felt to prove herself to this commander. “Therefore, I have decided we will remove the bandits from the bothersome place they currently occupy.”</p>

<p>She then turned to face her party, a mix of shock, approval, and miscellaneous other reactions drifting between them. “We have the combined magic, physical, and tactical strength to resolve this issue now. It would save a lot of lives and bolster our reputation among the Eraians. This shouldn’t take long. Any last input before we officially detour our mission?”</p>
