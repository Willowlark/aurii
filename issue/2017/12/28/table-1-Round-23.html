            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-12-28</em></p>

<p>“I’m not that much of a push over boy.” Orar says from behind Eliran as the bard approaches Aldus. Orar no longer looks uncomfortable with the goings on as he spins the minstral around with a pull on on of his arms. Orar snaps out with a one two punch upside the head and then steps in with a dropped shoulder, shoving his elbow into Eliran’s gut and his shoulder into his nose. It launches Eliran back a few paces into some of the other men in the room, leaving the lot of you in a pile. Orar steps to the side, putting himself between you and the other fighters.</p>

<p>Lac rubs his wrist with his uninjured arm, leaning heavily on his good leg. “What the literal hell…” The brute of a man mutters. He jumps forward behind Aldus as the wolf laguz moves his unconscious friend under the bed. Lac grabs the back of Aldus’s head with his massive hand and throws the wolf laguz into the wall with a crash. He then pivots on one foot, reaching down to grasp Aldus’s face. Using the wall to help support Aldus, Lac lifts the wolf to his feet with that single hand.</p>

<p>Lac’s other fist pounds into Aldus’s chest. “The. Hell. Is. Wrong. With. You!” the enforcer says through grit teeth. “Do you see me with a blade? Are you trying to kill me?”</p>

<p>“We. Are. Civil. lized. People!” Lac yells, each word punctuated with another punch. The enraged man then drops Aldus’s face and kicks the laguz away. Lac then steps away slowly to support Orar.</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-12-28</em></p>

<p>“Trying to…no of course not I just-” Hes cut short by Lac throwing his full weight into the wall, smacking him directly in the nose, as he falls back he notices a splotch of his blood on the plaster. Then he’s up, and turned around and Lacs ugly and equally as bloodied face is in his, breathing stale fish smell into his sensitive nostrils, making his stomach lurch. Then comes a series of blows to his hardened leather chest plate, but each one is harder than the last and by the fourth his he feels a pop somewhere deep in his chest. The fifth has his consciousness wavering greatly. Then Lac unceremoniously kicks him to the side. Aldus lands on his stomach <em>Now, who’s trying to kill who again?</em> he thinks, uneasily pushing himself up with his arms as Lac turns his back on him, toward Eliran. <em>you have to stop getting yourself involved in everyone else’s problems</em> he remembers his mother saying to him once, well it appears she was right. He should have kicked this bard, or actor, or whatever he was back out into the halway. <em>Too late now</em></p>

<p>Unstably getting himself to his feet, he fully realises how much trouble they are going to be in. There’s no way this encounter hasn’t been loud and obnoxious, and  giving its late evening there is no doubt someone is probably complaining to the innkeeper right now. He also realises that Lac probably assumes he’s passed out harmlessly in the corner he was kicked into given the fact that not only his but Orar’s and the remaining lackey’s attention are all focused on Eliran at the moment.</p>

<p>He <em>could</em> just grab Nokri and jump out the window, leaving the man to his fate. But he won’t, whoever he is surely he had no intentions of this happening, and seems a halfway honorable sort at least seeing he didn’t just simply let the two of them get slaughtered on his behalf without trying to help. He looks fit enough to be able to make the leap from the second floor window as well.</p>

<p>Aldus hopes his adrenaline will distract him enough from the pain in his chest, and face…and stomach. Trying not to think about how much this is going to hurt later Aldus slings Nokri up over one shoulder and slings his bow over the other. He attempts to get Eliran’s attention by waving his hand. He points to himself, then the window on his own side of the room. Then points to Eliran and the window on the adjacent side of the bed, closer to Eliran.</p>

<p>He sits and carefully moves himself through the window being extra careful not to hurt Nokri, takes one last look over at Eliran, hoping he will follow and pushes himself off the sill and falls down to the ground. He tries to absorb the shock by bending his knees when they hit the ground but a flash of pain emanating from <em>everywhere</em> causes him to lose balance and fall backward onto his butt instead. Still most of fall was broken and he regains his balance, pulls Nokri into the nearest alleyway and holds her wrist, making sure there’s a still a solid pulse. Then he holds his breath and prays to his stupid ancestors that this works out.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2018-01-01</em></p>

<p>Being spun around Eliran takes a one two punch upside the head and then gets hit with a dropped shoulder.As he is launched Eliran’s elbows happen to hit two of the mooks behind him in the temple, instantly knocking them out on accident, this leads to a chain reaction of falling, that also knocks the rest of the mooks behind them, with Eliran being the only one left awake and capable, although somewhat dazed and surprised by his apparent reign of terror.</p>

<p>Standing up, Eliran. notices a signal from Aldus, who seems to be faking unconsciousness, while planning to pick up unconscious chicks and hop out a window. Talk about a walk of shame. Making note of this plan, Eliran calls out towards the still open door, “Officer, these gang members are trying to kill us!” as a distraction, then he takes to the open window and ollies the fuck out, hopping outside, and running over to meet the Aldus out there.</p>
