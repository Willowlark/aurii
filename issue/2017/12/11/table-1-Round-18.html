            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-12-11</em></p>

<p>You start to get a lay of the land at the festival as you look for an inn. The massive tree in the center of town is surrounded by a wide, circular park where the festival at large is taking place. People mill about, walking in a literal circle as the activities and merriment changes.</p>

<p>True to the man’s word, finding an inn is easy in the festival. You quickly find one surrounded by mistrals and street preformers with a vacancy at a very good price. Given it’s almost central location there’s naught a reason to refuse lodging. Between the view, the smell of the food, and the cozy decor you really lucked out. After being given a key for your room upstairs, you’re assured there will be hot water available for a bath. If that didn’t float your boat, when you open the door to your room you can see the massive plush beds. The comforts of home be damned, a bed like that is what the gods sleep on.</p>

<p>As you step into your room, you can hear pounding from outside and down the hall. Peering out your door, no other door is open in the hall. From around the bend at one end of the hallway comes a young man with a Lute in one hand, sprinting from a much larger looking man dressed in black. The term that comes to mind is Gorilla, though calling him such would probably anger him even further. From up the staircase on the other end of the hall a second man in black comes charging up, taking a wide stance at the top of the stairs and blocking it off.</p>

<p>(ooc: welcome to the festival &lt;@!288513265661902858&gt; )</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-12-14</em></p>

<p>Aldus turns around, surprised and taken aback at the scene that as suddenly unfolded in the hall. He has half a mind to simple shut the door, lay down and sleep - effectively ignoring whoever this man and his pursuers maybe be. He stands in the doorway with Nokri next to him. He looks down to see if he can gauge her reaction to the situation, and to see weather or not she wants to get involved in whatever this conflict between the big men and the lute player may be.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2017-12-14</em></p>

<p>Dashing down the hall Eliran cursed himself, <em>Of course you had to pick a fight with the big baddie in the town during the one time of year you can’t leave it</em>. Looking towards the stairs ahead he realizes his exit has been cut off by Gorilla Grunt A. Glancing around, he looked for an open room, preferably one with a window to escape through, when  pair of heads suddenly popped out! Realizing that his only chance of escape was the pair of strangers ahead,  Eliran cried out to them in his most panick stricken voice, “Help! They’re trying to kill me!” As he sprinted towards the two strangers room, Eliran hoped that his cry for help was enough to convince them.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2017-12-14</em></p>

<p>Nokri’s face is, as usual, stoic and unimpressed. She was interested in the events taking place in the hallway, but it wasn’t her problem and she didn’t care enough to get involved. “What do you think he did?” she mused, wondering how such a chase began. Maybe he stole something, or he was so bad at playing that lute he insulted some noble.</p>

<p>She was right about to turn back into the room for some peace and quiet when things turns for the worst. The man being pursued noticed the two of them being nosy, and of course started heading their way.  “Shut the door, <em>shut the door</em>!” Nokri tried to grab Aldus and push him in and slam the door shut, but with how little distance there was between them and the stairs, there wasn’t enough time to fully close and lock the door before the panicked stranger reached them.</p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2017-12-14</em></p>

<p>Seeing that the two strangers were trying to avoid the situation altogether, Eliran cradled his lute and made a leap towards the slightly ajar door. As he crashed into the room with all the grace of a walrus launched on a catapult, Eliran wondered why his day always seemed to end with him crashing into a new problem.</p>
