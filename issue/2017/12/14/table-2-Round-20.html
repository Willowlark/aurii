            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-12-14</em></p>

<p>Ransford says nothing throughout your story, only responding with the occasional grunt or nod of the head. When you finish he crosses his arms, head down in thought.</p>

<p>‚ÄúKnight-lieutenant, I‚Äôm going to assume you ask for lodgings and rest for your charge and allies, not yourself. It would be terribly unbecoming of a soldier of Lylalel to unload his work onto others.‚Äù Ransford says without looking at Elfriede. You can imagine the expression on his face with just his tone.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need you to show us the way to the shack you mentioned as well. If you incapacitated as many as you say, if they start waking up while we‚Äôre searching for it in the dark your allies might be in serious trouble. Narder will have you cleaned up in a jiffy, he does great work.‚Äù he says to the Eraian knight-lieutenant. He then turns to Afina.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI have no right to suggest anything to you mi‚Äôlady, but if I might. I will need almost every man at this garrison doing something, either maintaining a skeleton crew here at the station or assisting in this unexpected need for a raid. I have no men I can give you for your protection. I need sir Faun‚Äôs guidence as well. My suggestion would be to return to the shack with the larger group. I will do whatever I can to suit your own plans, however.‚Äù he gives a short bow for politeness‚Äôs sake.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI have men to gather. We‚Äôll be leaving within the half hour Knight-lieutenant.‚Äù he says and turns on a heel out the door. As if by his bidding, the door slowly closes behind him with a soft click. Narder drops his hand from his salute. he says ‚ÄúBe just a few more minutes sir.‚Äù and returns to spellcrafting.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2017-12-14</em></p>

<p>As soon as the door shut Elfriede let out a defeated sigh. Elfriede seemed extremely childish in that moment, crossing his arms after being scolded and huffing. After remember that he wasn‚Äôt alone he quickly regained himself. He glances over to Narder hard at work, sighs and takes a seat on the bench a few feet behind him. He was <em>really</em> tired‚Ä¶ After all that travelling today, then a fight in which he sustained injuries, THEN travelling back here. He crossed his arms and huffed again, then briefly glanced up at Afina. Hopefully she wasn‚Äôt looking at him in this sorry grumpy state‚Ä¶ but he knew she was. He was the only one she knew all that well here. <em>Unless</em> she was just so in awe by the spectacular image of Narder. 
    ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôll just wait for Narder to clean us up then we‚Äôll get ready to head back out.‚Äù Elfriede grumbled half to himself.
    With heavy eyes Faun was thinking about the detour to the Laguz cabin. Ugh‚Ä¶ we could have been almost at the capitol by now. He rested his head on the wall behind him and as if an extremely delayed reaction Elfriede felt the extreme soreness caused by sitting back. He winced a bit at the dull pain coming from his lower back region and suddenly sat forward to take the pressure off his tail.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ )</strong> - <em>2017-12-15</em></p>

<p>Immediately, Narder pointed to a drain in the floor, and then gestured over to a bucket on the wall. Afina nodded slowly, hesitantly. Surely Narder didn‚Äôt mean to just dump the bucket on their heads. Narder lifted the bucket, gesturing for Elfriede to step up first. Oh, Narder <em>did</em>.</p>

<p>Elfriede sighed, accepting the cost of removing so much grime. Afina giggled, how rudimentary of the military to wash in such a way. Though, with the state of things, she wasn‚Äôt quite surprised. She watched as the water mingled with the red dye of the blood, and swirled around the drain. Judging from Elfriede‚Äôs distasteful reaction, there wasn‚Äôt much warm water in the outpost.</p>

<p>As Narder lifted a second bucket to dump, Afina flipped open her spell book, and a small sphere of bright heat appeared in the bucket with a sizzle. Narder hesitated to look down at it, before shrugging and dumping it on Elfriede once more. A much more pleasant experience, Afina nodded.</p>

<p>Narder moved towards her with Afina with the bucket, but she hold up a hand to stop him. Instead, she untied her cape and handed it to him to wash. After, they would be staying at an inn later to truly wash off; For now, she just needed the blood washed away. Narder nodded, dunking and swirling the bundle of blue fabric. Once he was finished, Afina laid it out on the bench, next to where Elfriede sat, drenched. She whispered a spell from her tomes once more, and a large ball of heat filled the room.</p>

<p>Afina watched as steam wafted from the damp clothing, disappearing into the air. Staying at the inn would be the most uneventful thing she had done in 24 hours. Since leaving Theanovene, she had gotten into many arguments, helped to take down a bandit base, and started making remarkable headway towards actually befriending others. She smiled to herself. Not bad, Afina.</p>
