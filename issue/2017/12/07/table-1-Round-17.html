            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-12-07</em></p>

<p>The guard looks up at you and smiles brightly before rising to his feet while brushing off his lap of the dust from the road.</p>

<p>“Good Afternoon! I can tell you that, and because you asked I can tell you’ve never been at the Hylley festival before have you?” he says retorically. “The gates are closed because the river beyond is about to become a rapid for the evening.” he says with a knowing smile of a story teller.</p>

<p>“Every year just before the winter season a massive flow of water pours from the river’s source in the western mountains. It floods dangerously ahead of the city and is far too dangerous for travelers. At the city limits it’s calmed enough that it fills the natural canals you might have seen walking through to the gate and flows brillantly through the whole city. The whole event lasts but an evening and we hold the festival to celebrate it. Especially since it’s the reason Hyll Tree stands as tall as it does.” he says with the ease of someone whose explained the story before.</p>

<p>“The story of the festival aside; we don’t allow anyone to travel out of the city into the rapids. You’ll have to stay the night in town. There’s plenty of inn space, don’t you worry. Not to mention you should really be staying for the festival itself!” he adds. “Now, unless you have any questions for me, I’ll leave you to it.” he says before plopping back into his chair.</p>

<p>(ooc: Unless you do have more questions for him, you can discuss in aside or just move into the festival area. Give me an idea of where your going and I’ll run from there monday.)</p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-12-08</em></p>

<p>“Oh, ummm thank you” he replies, feeling a little silly for thinking there would be more trouble afoot than this.</p>

<p>He turns around and heads back to where Nokri is standing and eating some kind of good smelling little puffs that he assumes are from one of the vendors nearby. He drags his eyes up from the food to her face.</p>

<p>“So the gate guard said that all of this is a festival in celebration of the fact that one day a year the source of the river releases a massive amount of water, flooding the area around town. That’s also why the gate is closed today, but it will re-open tomorrow.” He takes a breath “He suggested we enjoy the festival tonight and find an inn to stay in. Not a bad idea - It might be nice to sleep in a real bed again.” smiling wistfully at the thought.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2017-12-11</em></p>

<p>“What’s the word?” she asked as their conversation wrapped up and Aldus came back. Seeing as she was only half done hers, she somewhat reluctantly offered the second goodie bag to him.</p>

<p>“Did you ask the guard where the inns are?” Looking around, there was no shortage of people who could probably give them directions, but Nokri didn’t much feel like going around and asking questions like the obvious tourists they were. “Whatever. We’ll find one regardless. S’long as it’s cheap.”</p>

<p>She started walking down the street, still munching and looking at the various shops and signs that could point them in the right direction. “I want to find someplace with vacancy before all the rooms are booked up. Let’s go.”</p>
