            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-12-26</em></p>

<p>Lac ducks his head quickly to dodge the arrow fired by Aldus, leaving him wide open for a kick to the shin. He yowls and hops backward on his good leg. Nokri is unceremoniously dropped on the floor face first. Lac slams his foot back down and growls. He sticks his hands in his pockets and they come out adorned with brass knuckles. He steps over Nokri towards Aldus jabbing low into Aldus’s stomach before whirling into a haymaker aimed at Aldus’s cheek.</p>

<p>Orar sighs at the start of combat but takes a boxer’s ready pose. He steps towards Eliran and the man he just dropped. He makes two jabs which fall short of hitting Eliran which serve a dual purpose of getting within grabbing range. Orar wraps one his arms around Eliran’s, twisting the smaller man around. Eliran can feel a steel gauntlet under Orar’s sleeve as Orar holds Eliran tight to his chest.</p>

<p>“I’ve got our guy, let’s just leave!” Orar says over the sounds of fighting.</p>

<p>“To hell with that!” Lac replies.</p>

<p><strong>Nokri (Marisa)</strong> - <em>2017-12-28</em></p>

<p>A busted door, a broken wall, a scratched up floor. The hotel owners were going to <em>love</em> them. Nokri could feel the money she had saved up flying out of her purse and into the great beyond. Seething with rage, she tried to take advantage of the situation and kick her assailant to get free after he lost his balance. She underestimated just how off-balance he was though. Unprepared for a sudden descent, Nokri fell straight down, unceremoniously hitting the ground like a ragdoll. Luckily enough, her face also caught the side of the bedpost, and she smacked the side of her head hard against the wood with a <em>thwap</em>. Some choice words ran through her mind, but her consciousness faded before being able to spit anything out, and she could only hope some thug didn’t fall and crush her from there on out. <em>Eh, Aldus’ll be able to take care of them anyway. Probably.</em></p>

<p><strong>Aldus (Jess)</strong> - <em>2017-12-28</em></p>

<p>A flash of pain radiates from his abdomen, his eyes whince shut in reaction just before a hard and fast punch hits him square in the jaw. His head swoons and the taste of blood fills his mouth. He spits onto the floor and rotates back to face Lac gritting his pointed teeth and growling, his toned arms tighten and his left fist clenches tighter around his bow.</p>

<p>He punches out fast into the side of Lac’s face with his bow, using the pointed metal knocks on the outside to stab into his face and throw him off balance. Then pulls an arrow out with his right hand and, using it like a dagger stabs into Lac’s right wrist in an attempt to make Lac drop one of his weapons. He tears the arrow back out and knocks it in its rightful place, simultaneously hooking  his left foot behind Lac’s right leg, tripping him.</p>

<p>It’s then that he notices a very still Nokri on the floor next to the bedpost, A trail of blood stemming from her forehead. “Oh no” he says in an undertone, despite her overall attitude toward him he couldn’t help feeling somewhat drawn to the small angry woman. “You bastard!” he exclaims with a new found strength, he half-steps backward and fires an arrow into Lac’s other foot, while staring directly and coldly into his eyes. Despite the close range and not even looking at his target he does not miss.</p>

<p>He takes a deep breath, eyes going wide for a moment while he steals himself. He reaches down and swiftly moves Nokri unto the bed and then lands his eyes on the body sprawled out near… <em>Cantaret… Is that what he said his surname was?</em> The body isn’t moving, but Aldus tries not to think about that right now, <em>deal with that later</em> he tells himself <em>at least it was quick?</em></p>

<p><strong>Eliran (Halim)</strong> - <em>2017-12-28</em></p>

<p>“Rude” Eliran says, half to himself and half to Orar, as he gets pulled into an arm lock. Feeling the steel gauntlet on his back Eliran comments to Orar, “You seem nice so I <em>really</em> don’t want to hurt you..” <em>but your boss is a murderous asshole that disrespects women</em> he thought to himself.  Breaking free of the mans grasps, Eliran immediately drops low and stabs him in the inner thigh, <em>this should at least immobalize him</em> and then goes to sweep him, forcing Orar to the ground. hopping back a few steps to gage the room, Eliran leaves Orar helpless on the ground,.</p>

<p>Noticing Nokri’s now limp body, he is filled with dread, <em>this is my fault</em> he thought to himself. Why did he have to get these two involved in his Problem? <em>Stupid Stupid Stupid</em>. He thought. Looking at the remaining mooks, he set himself poised to fight, now next to Aldus, who he noticed looking at the now dead mook from before, “Sorry” Eliran said almost absentmindedly to the mook. He didn’t like to kill, but he knew this wouldn’t end anytime soon without some blood being spilt.</p>
