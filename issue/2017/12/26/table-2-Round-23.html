            <p><strong>Bill</strong> - <em>2017-12-26</em></p>

<p>Ransford’s boot hit the floor behind you with a creak. “Alright boys, we have a building to clear. Two men to a doorway, clear the room and mark the door. Don’t split too far from the group.” he calls. The men ahead begin a coordinated advance. They head down the hallway in two columns. When they approach a doorway the first two flank the door and push it in. The two rotate in together, swords raised. When they clear it the slash the floorboard and reenter the columns. If it’s occupied the two fall behind to subdue the man inside.</p>

<p>Ransford speaks over Elfriede and Afina’s shoulders. “Don’t worry about clearing. We’re waiting for when something happens. Keep those eyes peeled.” Things go on like this for what feels like a million doors. You can feel the floors slope further and further down the side of the cliff.</p>

<p>The number of men dwindles, with only half a dozen in front of the three of you as you enter a large room filled with crates and barrels. In the center of the the room is a hexagon shaped section of the floor that is mounted to a pulley system with large chains on each of the corners of the hex. Quite a few bandits hunkered down in this room, using the boxes and barrels for cover as they fire arrows across the room into the shields of the front line men. Over half a dozen more dash out with scimitars and axes to enter melee combat.</p>

<p><strong>Elfriede (Tom)</strong> - <em>2017-12-26</em></p>

<p>As the arrows thudded into the leather shields and clanged off of the metallic ones Elfriede readied himself with his usual. In his right hand a long, double bearded yet skinny rapier and in his left hand a small defensive dagger with wrist guards designed specifically for catching blades and turning them aside. He glanced to Afina then Ransford and nodded to each as if to confirm what they all understood: this would most likely be one of the hardest fights of the night with the dwindling soldier reserves.</p>

<p>The laguz advanced, Elfriede, agile despite recent events, dashed right and low around the ally soldiers and emerged in front of an engaging muscular laguz female who was already bringing down a sharp two handed Flamberge. More often than not bandits with unwieldy weapons use them for appearance more than actually usefulness. They were unwieldy. Elfriede reversed the grip on his dagger and brought it shoulder height at an angle downward and met the heavy sword, throwing its weight outward to the left of Elfriede and straight down into the floor splintering the wood floor and knocking up the shale underneath.
Elfriede brought his rapier down directly through the left knee of the tiger-featured woman, then his armoured shin came around back and kicked fiercely into the back of the leg, crumpling any balance the bandit might have had. She howled at the suddenly seering sensation from her leg. During all this, Elfriede withdrew his sword from the leg and did a backward rotation. As the laguz came down on their back, Elfriede brought his left boot straight out in a side kick and connected directly with the woman’s jaw. One last glance and Elfriede saw the whites of her eyes as they rolled back from the impact.</p>

<p><strong>“Don’t get up.”</strong></p>

<p>Faun desperately wanted to glance back to see Afina reaction to the practiced routine and maybe gloat a bit, but wasn’t the time. There were plenty more where that came from.</p>

<p><strong>Afina (Georgia🍀 )</strong> - <em>2017-12-26</em></p>

<p>Afina’s heart had been beating hard ever since they descended the trapdoor. Long gone was the bravado from just a few minutes before, as the reality of the situation sunk in. They were in the center of a laguz stronghold. This wasn’t going to be an easy fight, and Afina knew it. She had talked a big fight in front of Elfriede, and <em>especially</em> Ransford, but standing in the dim atrium, surrounded by fighting soldiers, she wasn’t quite sure.</p>

<p>As the first laguz emerged for a battle, Afina found herself frozen in fear. This was many more laguz than she had ever seen in a <em>peaceful</em> setting, much less a violent one. Her reading hand shook, and her boots felt is if they were stuck to the floor. Come on, Afina, you look ridiculous now, she thought. Only an idiot leads men through the forest with the confidence of a thousand commanders, only to cower in fear when the blood starts spilling. Tyndalls pursued peace until the last possible second, but these bandits didn’t seem to take that option into account.</p>

<p>When the fighting had started, Elfriede immediately jumped into action. Of course, he had been radiating energy since their conversation outside, and it hadn’t seemed to dwindle in their course through the stronghold. Not even Ransford’s reprimanding had depressed his mood. A small smirk snuck onto Afina’s face as she remembered his challenge of authority. “I won’t be caught so off guard this time… Afina”, he had said, dropping the quintessential title designated for her social rank. What a little–, Afina thought, suddenly distracted as Elfriede withdrew his sword from a laguz woman’s leg and kicked her squarely in the jaw. Afina cocked her head as she watched him taunt the incapacitated laguz. Huh, she thought. She had to admit to being a little impressed. Not that that gave him the right to call her “Afina” just yet.</p>

<p>To her other side, Ransford fought, with less agility and more power than Elfriede. Even the dim lights of the atrium gave his salt and pepper hair a distinct sheen, though he hardly broke a sweat. Or… was he? Something stirred in the old man’s face that wasn’t the familiar hardness of a commanding officer. Was he worried? Or was he <em>enjoying</em> himself? Afina couldn’t stand to see even the elderly guy beating her in combat. She was a princess, but certainly not a damsel in distress.</p>

<p>Afina had burned through a lot of pages in their travels today, but nonetheless she still had some tricks up her sleeves. She had done the ball of light, the disks of light heat, the shower of sparks… finally, she landed on the page she wanted. Afina’s hand shook, and she flexed it, forcing her nervous body to obey her mind. She began to read, one hand holding the book and the other outstretched before her, eyeing a laguz target near Elfriede. If he was going to show off, so would she.</p>

<p>Fixated on the bandit, Afina conjured a circle of light around him on the floor. The lumbering laguz froze upon seeing the bright halo, squinting to inspect the magic circle for but a moment. In one swift motion, Afina’s free hand raised into the air, and the circle on the ground turned into a tube, the walls of which confirmed the laguz man inside. She could vaguely hear confused yelling, and yelps of pain as the man dared press a hand to the barriers of light. His hands seared with pain at the touch of the light, and he wiggled to avoid the surface of the tube. Every few seconds, the light would flicker, but then return with the same brilliant intensity. With concentrated focus, Afina closed her fist, and the tube coalesced into a single beam of light that shot up from the ground. The laguz man trapped inside wailed, his sword clattering to the floor with a metallic crash. Finally, Afina released the spell and the light abruptly faded, revealing a trembling bandit on his hands and knees, just as a garrison soldier went for the final blow to the head.</p>

<p>Afina exhaled shakily, relaxing her posture. She hadn’t quite perfected the spell, but that effort had been her best yet. And if her timing had been correct, and Elfriede wasn’t dumb and blind, then he must’ve seen the very same feat. The corner of Afina’s mouth cracked into a small smile. That’ll teach you to drop the “lady” title, she thought. Her reverie was cut short as another laguz, noting the damage she had caused to his companion, began to charge. Afina inhaled quickly, standing straight, palm facing out and hurriedly reading from her book. Sparks shot forward from her hand, catching on the bandits body and scorching through his clothes, but it did little to slow his quickening approach. Afina panicked, dropping her book and hurriedly unsheathing her dagger. She only knew how to counter with this weapon, so she would have to wait for a soldier to take over the duty of attacking.</p>
