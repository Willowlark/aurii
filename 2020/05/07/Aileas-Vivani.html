<h1 id="appearance">Appearance</h1>

<p>Aileas is very obviously Irish. Her hair is fire red and her face has a line of dense freckles from ear to ear, between her nose and eyes. Her eyes are an emerald green. She has a small face, making her look younger than she is. Her facial features are subtle, neither hard nor soft. Her hair is naturally straight, and comes down to a little above her bust. She has bangs, usually swept to one side. She wears it <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/22/63/ab/2263abe9b617a20368ecf197db496a4e.jpg">up</a> when busy and pressed, and she’ll wear it with a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e3/1e/0e/e31e0e69d37666c0df252417f15003e4.jpg">ribbon low in the back</a>, bringing it to a small tail near the end of it’s length. Her ears are pierced and typically have gold studs.</p>

<p>Aileas stands around 5’ 5” without shoes. She has a lithe build and a modest bust, built for agility and movement rather than power. Her curves are subtle, leaving her <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/22/63/ab/2263abe9b617a20368ecf197db496a4e.jpg">shoulders square with her hips</a> normally.</p>

<h1 id="casual-outfits">Casual Outfits</h1>

<p>When working, she will frequently adorn a white long sleeve shirt, green flannel loosely buttoned over it, a military style grey jacket, a cap, and black skinny jeans.</p>

<h1 id="magical-girl-outfit">Magical Girl Outfit</h1>

<p>Aileas wears an army green <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/fc/18/d4/fc18d4b9bf58e4a18262e9adeac0c307.jpg">Military Lolita Dress</a> such as this with the following differences. The top is cut differently, with short sleeves and an untucked look, like <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9c/6d/86/9c6d86994e1a622d3c459393cbdbeb57.jpg">here</a>. The detailing is the same as the original, the base shape is the only thing that’s changed. The belts from the first dress have been removed, instead the cut of the dress matches the second’s. The skirt has had the gold emblem shifted 45 degrees in both directions, now on the left and right side of the skirt. She has <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a5/43/2f/a5432f55e5e114f1d4addc5f4f75bcd8.jpg">lace gloves</a> that match her dress’s color and extend past her wrist. Her socks are thigh high and black, with a gold ring at the top. She wears brown, military style boots with gold accents that rise above her ankle. When a magical girl, her hair is always in the same <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ad/ba/f0/adbaf0e50124544a03d193d6649c6ef6.jpg">style</a>. The sides are pulled behind her, clipped with a large green and gold bow with the same emblem from the circle on the knot.</p>

<h1 id="history">History</h1>

<p>Aileas lives in a small town south of Baskin Ireland, near Carrickwood. Her hometown is more village than town, and she grew up playing in the woods and hills. Never much for confrontation and generally quiet girl, most of her childhood was following along with a group, often the boys in school as they adventured through the woods. Her Mother died when she was quite young, though her Father has told her many stories about her. Her father is a woodworker in town. He doesn’t have any major claim to fame, but he gets frequent business from farms outside of the Hunts Grove area and that’s good enough for him. As the boys took to video games and staying indoors more as they grew up; Aileas took to wandering the woods herself. She frequently hiked about before dinner, journaling paths and things she saw, all to tell her father.</p>

<p>Aileas became a magical girl out of neccessity at the age of 15. One hot summer evening her class met up in the woods, the boys to hold an unsupervised airsoft tournament and the girls coming along for the ride. The ringleader of the group, a boy with a unusual habit of being rude to Aileas, insisted it was a guy’s activity and she couldn’t compete. The tournament started, and as time passed the boys didn’t resurface at all. Eventually worry took over and the group not playing took to searching, calling out for their missing companions. Aileas is separated from the group when she slides down an embankment. She eventually approaches a clearing near the lake, where Fomori demons have come from the lake, brainwashed her friends and are bringing them down into the water.</p>

<p>A small strange looking Otter like creature that looks like it’s been crying approaches her, informing her that mythology is very much rooted in fiction. It looks her up and down and then bestows on her it’s power, only saying ‘destroy them’, in reference to the Fomori. A discarded airsoft sniper rifle inspires her as she transforms into a magical girl. She takes out the Fomori attacking her friends, all of them left unconscious. It’s at this point the Otter explains Aileas is now a magical guardian of Ireland, tasked with banishing evil such as the Fomori who are trying to revive their leader, Balor the Evil Eyed King. She also meets a boy who looks incredibly like her who had helped her with magic powers of his own. The Otter explains that he a mainfestion of her twinned soul, an alternate being of magic. He takes this with quiet shock, and makes himself scare before the normal humans wake up.</p>

<p>Aileas sleeps a day and a half after waking her friends up, coming up with a poisonous mist excuse as to why they all passed out, and getting them home. The morning she wakes, there’s a knock on the door. The Irish Anti Magic Coalition (IMAC), a secret government organization dealing with magical uprisings and issues affecting Ireland, sent a representative. Ireland’s magical protector is considered a member of the organization by default and Aileas is whisked away to her new ‘internship with the Irish government at a special boarding school’. Her twinned soul brother is given papers as Myles Vivani as part of the deal, though Aileas chooses not to explain any of this to her father. She reluctantly agrees to be dragged along, and has been ever since. Now 16, she has gained some pull with IMAC, due to respect for her accomplishments and work ethic, as well as her realizing she is defacto the best weapon IMAC has against Balor’s minions. She still works with them, but operates more independently.</p>

<h1 id="personality">Personality</h1>

<p>Aileas is inherently a quiet girl, especially after her transformation to a magical girl. Over a year of being ordered around by a military organization has run her ragged, and she hasn’t even realized it yet. Her curiosity about the world as a child is dampened by battles and orders, and the things she’s seen and done weigh on her. She hasn’t killed anyone, but she’s seen literal evil at work and it’s jarring to her. Her typical mood in the present is quiet and anxious, lost in everything that goes on around her.</p>

<p>Aileas, at heart, is an observer and explorer. She feels at home in trees and on hills, outdoors and alive. She likes poetry, though she hasn’t written since becoming a magical girl. She also likes song, and loves acoustic guitar. She feels most at home around other people, but not as the center of attention. She basks in the energy from other people, supplementing when she chooses but never feeling the need to take charge. Her time with the IMAC has given her the ability to give orders, but it’s stressful for her and she becomes quiet and and anxious when she does. She likes take things slowly and savor them whenever possible. On rare occasions she can be competitive, usually without reason and fleetingly so.</p>

<p>Aileas feels a strange sense of responsibility towards her ‘brother’, Myles. She created him and he is her, yet he’s different from her in some clear ways. She frequently tries to get him to do things unrelated to IMAC and magic, to help him find roots and interests in the real world. The fact that he’s so dedicated to the IMAC mission worries her, she doesn’t want him to feel like he was created to serve. They don’t brooch this topic however, instead choosing to dance around it. Aileas and Myles share a deep bond, one of trust despite only truly knowing each other for a year. They act like childhood friends at times, and other times they have no idea what to do with each other. Aileas quickly came to care deeply for him, after he was created. He warmed up to her slower, but by 16 the ‘twins’ both willing to do anything for the other.</p>

<h1 id="combat-ability">Combat Ability</h1>

<p>Aileas has control over gravity, and impressive control at that. Her magic tutors inform her that her control over the element is at a gifted level frequently. She is capable on increasing/decreasing gravity over medium area, or a handful of individual areas at once. She can reduce the effective of it on herself and long jump, increase her running speed by kicking off and floating and glide through the air. She has yet to be able to completely reduce gravity on herself and give herself the ability to fly. She can cause other things to float in zero G though. She can target specific items, such as weapons thrown at her, and force them to the ground or into the sky.</p>

<p>Aileas is primarily a ranged combatant. Her weapon is an <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a3/88/46/a38846d74dc4e9d4ca21d11c8e336a42.jpg">Anti Material Rifle</a>. She has proper rounds for it on her person, but has only used them against particularly stubborn demons, preferring magical ammunition whenever humans are in the area. She can attune the magical ammunition to have special properties such as ignore non magical beings like humans. She’s an excellent shot and very patient, allowing her to do heavy damage before needing to move positions. Her rifle is cumbersome at close range, even when the barrel telescopes in to reduce length. She uses her gravity powers to eliminate fall off on her rounds.</p>

<p>Aileas, due to her gifted ability to use magic, picked up Sorcery from mages at the IMAC. The runic magic of Irish tradition is usable by anyone, though humans can only produce extremely weak effects. Her abilities as a magical girl allow her to power those weak effects to be much more useful. She’s learned many runes that allow her to balance her combat abilities with utility ones given she has enough time to write out the runes.</p>

<p>Aileas has access to a magical artifact which takes the form of a white glove. When worn, magic from the wearer is transferred into whatever is touched as a healing force. As long as Aileas has mana, and the being touched is alive, her magic will slowly heal them. It’s too slow to be effective, requiring hours for even moderate injuries.</p>

<p>Aileas has a second ability in addition to her Twinned Soul Myles; that of the Third Eye. She can see magic as if it had physical form, typically wisps of colored smoke of colored lights of varying intensity. She can also see spells being formed before they’re fired off, giving her time to dodge. Finally she has proven able to see through illusions when using this ability. Her right eye becomes blue when the ability is in use.</p>

<h1 id="myles-vivani">Myles Vivani</h1>

<h1 id="appearance-1">Appearance</h1>

<p>Myles has more squared off features compared to his ‘sister’, typical of a masculine face. He doesn’t retain the same young look Aileas does due to it, instead his masculine jawline helps him almost look older. His freckles match his ‘sister’s, a heavy dose of them from ear to ear between the nose and eyes. His eyes are also emerald green. His ears are pierced. His hair is the same red as Aileas. He also has <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/84/33/c3/8433c360ec316e00e3595ba76478b4c7.jpg">bangs</a>, and due the shorter length his hair has some wave to it. He doesn’t keep it tight to his face, instead it has some body to it.</p>

<p>Myles does more physical work than Aileas and has quickly built up some muscle. He’s by no means muscular but his build is starting to feel so, especially compared to Aileas. His legs are more obviously toned than his arms and torso, though they aren’t far behind. He stands at 5’ 7”.</p>

<h1 id="casual-outfits-1">Casual Outfits</h1>

<p>Myles wears an green henley shirt and black jeans when he chooses to go out. When hanging around, he wears a light weight t shirt (also green) and black cargo pants.</p>

<h1 id="magical-boy-outfit">Magical Boy Outfit</h1>

<p>The color scheme of Myles’s outfit is identical to Aileas’s, primary green with gold accents. The <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/bd/f8/c1/bdf8c15a06567315127ef28ff7d42793.jpg">base</a> of his outfit is a gold detailed green button up, with short sleeves. The collar accents mirror the base of of the color on <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/fc/18/d4/fc18d4b9bf58e4a18262e9adeac0c307.jpg">Aileas’s dress</a>. His shorts are a deeper green and go to just above the knee. They flare out at the bottoms. His entire leg below the knee is incased in massive boots, which are black with gold, lolita and lace inspired, intricate details down the front. The greaves <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/78/67/13/78671361bde80d38cf962b7b72b048f2.jpg">portion</a> of the boot come to a point at the top, when he stands straight up the point of the greave is just above his knee. The boots portion are bulky, black, and military in nature. They seemlessly integrate with the greave and allow full range of motion for him. Up both his arms are ribbons snaking around his forearm and upper arm until they disappear under his shirt.</p>

<h1 id="history-1">History</h1>

<p>Myles has no history of his own before he came into being when Aileas was made a magical girl. He is a twinned soul, a copy of Aileas powered by her mana, real in every way except his life is tied to her own. He can die on his own, and Aileas will live, but should Aileas die he will go with her. He has hazy memories that are actually Aileas’s, and know everything of the world Aileas did when he was created. They do not share any kind of thought link, a fact his greatful for.</p>

<p>When Aileas was pressed into service with IMAC, IMAC provided Myles with papers that verified him as a full citizen and twin brother of Aileas. Myles took to working with IMAC quickly, more engaged in training and the IMAC mission than his ‘sister’. It gave him a sense of purpose, something he tried desperately not to think about in the first few days he existed. Myles’s only orders, per a law passed through IMAC from an earlier Twinned Soul, is to assist Aileas at all times. IMAC has no ability to separate them, and they will never be, if they can help it. In the new world (entirely, for Myles) the two found themselves in they knew they could trust each other, as they’re technically one in the same.</p>

<h1 id="personality-1">Personality</h1>

<p>Myles is quiet, in a more standoffish way than Aileas. While Aileas is pensive and anxious, Myles is stoic and blunt. He has no qualms about saying his opinion on a mission, order, or personal matter. He’s dedicated and very hard working, always looking to be busy. He doesn’t take as much time away from IMAC as Aileas, only doing so when she asks him to come along. He enjoys the time spent with his other half, but finds himself uncomfortable in crowds.</p>

<p>Myles feels very much like an imposter and a fake, given his magical origin. While Aileas has insisted that he has no obligation to her, he can’t help but think his only reason to exist is to help her fight things. He avoids thinking about his role in the world as a whole whenever possible, preferring to focus on the present mission or training session. He doesn’t like to be idle, as when he has time to think his thoughts wander back to his lack of purpose.</p>

<p>Myles has dabbled with a handful of hobbies, mostly at the pressure of Aileas. Most her own hobbies didn’t take, though he took slightly to painting. He finds it too time consuming to invest in though. He’s practiced every combat skill he can get his hands on, from firearms to police baton. He likes to read mythology, at first he did so to learn about his enemies weaknesses but soon found he liked the lessons taught through the stories. Magic is less intuitive to him, but he does put effort into studies of Rune Magic to at least be at the same level as his ‘sister’.</p>

<p>Myles, when not brooding or trying to distract himself from brooding, is actually a people person. He’s quick with a joke and picks up on other’s moods well. Given some stability, he’d fall into a more social role than his ‘sister’ does when she’s relaxed. Were he to get to that point, he’d be the kind of person everyone loves who tells stories, laughs, and contributes. Leadership, both socially and in the military, is not something he wants to do but he’s quite capable.</p>

<h1 id="combat-ability-1">Combat Ability</h1>

<p>Myles’s combat style came into being with him; He’s able to make use of the Gravity power he shares with his sister to perform amazing feats in melee. He primarily uses kicks and his lightened form, the weakened gravity letting him do spinning combos and dodge in impossible ways. He’s also capable of increasing the force of his downward kicks by increasing Gravity on his leg. These devastating axe kicks can cleave a demon in two. Myles can perform similar feats to Aileas with his Gravity powers, though he tends to stick to the mobility ones. He’s not as skilled as Aileas at manipulating gravity fields away from himself.</p>

<p>Myles is used to running interference for Aileas in the field. He stays up close and beats on on foes, taking out anyone able to respond with ranged attacks at his ‘sister’ and forcing targets out of cover. He’s a skilled combatant in his own right, but the teamwork defines them and makes Aileas go from effective to deadly.</p>

<p>Myles is also able to use rune magic for utility spells.</p>

<p>Myles has the ability to create ‘shadow clones’ of himself. He uses the ability to bluff a large group, giving him time to eliminate one or two targets before the rest catch on and gang up on him, and to create distractions in one on one duels. He’s not fond of the ability, as he compares it to how he has no purpose in life.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="marielle-sabrina-myesha-genevie-visocsky">Marielle-Sabrina Myesha Genevie Visocsky</h1>

<h1 id="appearance-2">Appearance</h1>

<p>Marielle has long blonde hair and green eyes. She looks her age, with baby fat still on her cheeks. She wears a bow in hair, on the back of her head. Her magical girl outfit is an frilly blue dress, which is clearly inspired by japanese magic girl outfits. She has a heart motif. She has arm length gloves and ankle high boots, with tights. Her civilian outfits are similarly frilly.</p>

<h1 id="history-2">History</h1>

<p>Marielle was born to a rich family. She stumbled upon a magic incident much the same way Aileas did, at the age of 10. She’s been a magical girl for two years longer than Aileas, and makes a point of reminding Aileas and Myles whenever possible. She’s been kept from truly dangerous scenarios before Aileas and Myles join IMAC, but now that she has backup they’ve been thrown into much more dangerous situations.</p>

<h1 id="personality-2">Personality</h1>

<p>Marielle is loud, enthusiastic, and loves the concept of being a magical girl. She’s the annoying brat sister of everyone in IMAC, but she works very hard at her role as magical defender. She is stand offish with Aileas at first, thinking she’ll lose her place and the role she loves so much, but after a few missions where Aileas relied on Marielle Marielle quickly warmed up to her. While on the surface Marielle acts above Aileas due to her longer tenure as a magical girl, Marielle recognizes the wisedom and observation talents of Aileas and when it matters Marielle falls into line. Outside of IMAC work she lives every moment to the fullest, between mandatory schooling and training.</p>

<h1 id="combat-ability-2">Combat Ability</h1>

<p>Marielle uses a magical handgun in combat. She isn’t fond of the image, but does her best to make it feel like a ‘magical girl’s’ weapon. It fires light rounds, powered by her affinity to light. Marielle is skilled with firing delayed shots; the energy waits until she fires a later shot to go off. This is a manifestation of her barrage ability. She’s been working on transforming the gun into a full automatic via her barrage ability but she has yet to master it. Marielle is trained in close quarters, despite her appearance. She’s more than capable defending herself if she’s not out numbered.</p>
