<p><strong>Did not meet with a god</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>

<p>Alba has a lair in plain sight, in the middle of Omeron. His merchant servants sell the forest elves potions to 
the nobility as cosmetics and typical potions. Between this, his magical aptitude elevating him to the nobility,
and some smart business manuevers, he was able to lay claim to a small mansion in the center city easily. He
can easily get emotional DPU from this location, and he’s expanded underground as well. He faded to the back of 
people’s minds after that, being a quiet and eccentric noble to outsiders.</p>

<p>Alba detests the caste system in Omeron and looks for small ways to improve the lower caste’s lives, until he can
do something major. He is disillusioned even his powers would let him truly change people though. He sets up front
businesses that do little but peddle goods for almost no profit, just to keep people employed fairly. He’s just
started these kinds of operations.</p>

<p>Alba hides in plain sight, though Magnus is driven mad with sensing him in the city. Magnus is sent on magical
goose chases frequently to keep him off of Alba’s scent. Alba has a token that will let him meet with Lorkmar,
a final gift from his benefactor. Alba detests Lorkmar’s warmongering ways and is avoiding needing to treat with
the god as long as possible.</p>

<p>Alba and Magnus have met before. Magnus is able to see through illusions and discovered Alba’s lair, despite Yoko
and his best efforts. Magnus was curious, seeing the demon lord producing potions and mundane items, employing 
humans, and having only a handful of servants. Alba and Magnus talked and agreed that Omeron is a terrible place.
Magnus decides to offer Alba a deal; Magnus will focus on other issues for Lorkmar and Alba will help Magnus out
at his request, and Magnus will let Alba live on in the city. The two have a tentative peace, Magnus sees none of
the typical demon lord traits in Alba and until he does he’d like to see if Alba’s deed could speak for him,
wondering if a demon lord could actually be in Lorkmar’s good graces. Magnus also appreciates Alba as another
outlander, not from this plane.</p>

<p>Yoko, the core guardian for Alba, is frequently exasperated with the man. He protects humans and is a pacifist 
himself, driving her mad. Alba is infinitely patient with her, willing to listen to her opinion to any length,
but he stands firm. Yoko does respect Alba for helping the abused though, as she can relate to the scenario.
He relies on her magical knowledge greatly, and her council.</p>

<p>Alba’s other primary council is a fallen angel, his first servant summon. She is powerful, a fighter, and tired
of it all. She serves out of obligation and no longer passion, though Alba giving her pretty much free reign
is appreciated. He’s come to trust her experience and impartial attitude to most topics, them both
being disillusioned with the actions of humanity, and relies on her council as well as Yoko’s. Both reside with 
him in the mansion.</p>

<p>Alba additionally has a third council, a Danuki Merchant who manages his other merchants. The man is calculating
and cold, yet has an understated belief in the world around him. He serves well, but frequently encourages Alba
to take risks in believing in humans, as opposed to the fallen angels disillusion and Yoko’s hatred.</p>

<p>The other demon lord is a violent, stereotypical demon lord. She utterly exhausts Alba in both energy and 
drive to be the way she is. He treats with her on occasion, never getting involved in her machinations but
never opposing them. She may do evil but he doesn’t believe the world can be changed and better the devil you
know. He wouldn’t call her a friend, but were she to get in over her head…</p>

<p>Alba eventually meets a girl. A girl in the lower caste, whose treated like garbage and yet still smiles and 
tries to help others, rather than herself. He falls for her, and treats to buy her from her owner. The owner
pulls a scheme, and the girl dies. Yoko and the fallen angel both warn him that humans cannot be trusted and he
should forget about her, yet he’s willing to take one risk. He uses the Incarnation Circle to revive her as a 
spirit enchanter. She’s not sure how to take that a demon lord saved her, and that her life is changed forever. 
He protects her as she decides what she feels, and she has full freedom to leave his side.</p>

<p><strong>Plot hooks</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The girl
Magnus discovers Alba, the broker a peace to see if Alba’s deeds can speak for him
Treating with Lorkmar (Tied with above?)
The other demon lord gets in over her head
The Fallen Angel’s story
The girl shows Yoko humanity still has a spark of goodness
Dealing with the nobility and the caste system, protecting the weak
Plotting to fix the caste system, once and for all
His weakness, emotional dampening on a large scale</p>
